This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 11.21% for POS products (56346NC002) and 10.70% for HMO products (56346NC001).Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 3,000 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 9.8% year over year excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in North Carolina, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&#61623; The cost for an outpatient hospital service has increased 10%.&#61623; The cost for an inpatient hospital admission has increased 5.4%.&#61623; Costs for pharmacy prescriptions are increasing 7% year over year due to the release of Sovaldi for Hepatitis-C patients.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer North Carolina small businesses a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements, as well as to comply with the metal value requirements for small group plan designs. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes increased expected medical costs by an average of 2.5%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&#61623;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing (also known as the Federal Transitional Policy)&#61623; Enhanced network access standards&ndash; which limit our ability to control the cost and quality of medical care&#61623; Changes to required taxes and feesWill Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 11.21% or 10.70%?No, the stated increases are averages. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down. Others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling employees, where in North Carolina the group is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that groups pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access My Online Services, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services.

Health care service costs increase as health care providers increase their fees, members use more health care services and supplies, and the types of health care services and supplies change, among other factors.  Nearly half of the change in health care service costs is driven by changes to health care provider fees.Changes in Benefits:Some plan benefits are mandated by federal and state law.

These actions include:&bull;	Developing new agreements, arrangements, and  partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull;	Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have.

The rate increase being requested is 18.3 percent in aggregate. The requested rate increase varies by plan within the individual PPO product with a minimum increase of 12.6 percent and a maximum increase of 25.4 percent. The biggest driver of the rate change is setting underlying claims morbidity to better reflect the 2015 individual single risk pool compared to 2014. HPIC's emerging experience in 2014 indicates higher costs than were expected in 2014 pricing, resulting in a paid loss ratio to date of over 100 percent. In addition, the presence of transitional policies has the effect of narrowing the pool of enrollees for coverage.  Transitional policies are expected to have lower morbidity than ACA compliant policies since plans issued prior to January 1, 2014 were subject to medical underwriting, leaving a pool of potential enrollees for ACA-compliant plans that have higher morbidity than expected when developing 2014 premium rates.

Alaska&rsquo;s general standard of review is that rates may not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory (i.e. not unreasonable). Celtic provided the information and analysis as specifically required under 3 AAC 31.235 and other information requested during the course of the review.The Division reviewed the data and information provided by Celtic in support of the requested rate increase including but not limited to historical and projected claims, premiums, expenses, health care cost and utilization experience, as well as the method and rating factors that determined the rate increase.  Based on this review, the Division concluded that the 19 percent rate increase was justified and not unreasonable.  The reasons for the rate increase include base period experience, medical trend, reduced reinsurance, and leveraging.  As of the date of approval of the rate filing, Celtic had no Alaska residents covered under the one plan offered in Alaska in 2014.  With the requested rate increase, Celtic projects to meet the 80 percent medical loss ratio and therefore expects no rebates will be paid.The rate change will become effective on January 1, 2015.",Not Applicable,"Celtic Insurance Company is (Celtic) is proposing to increase premium rates by 19.41% for its ACA compliant Bronze major medical product offered in the State of Alaska.

The Department concluded that these standards were met and consequently the rates were not disapproved.",Not Applicable,"SummaryAetna is filing rates for Small Group plans in New Jersey. This filing proposes to reduce premium rates from our prior filing. The resulting annual increase is 10.1%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from April 2015 through December 2015. As of September 2014, approximately 74,000 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 11.2%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in New Jersey, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&bull; Expenses for emergency treatment have increased 10%.&bull; Primary care physician office visits have increased 10%.&bull; Costs for pharmacy prescriptions have gone up 11%.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsThe rates in this filing reflect the impacts of a number of ACA-related requirements, including changes to taxes and fees and changes to benefit requirements.Will Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 10.1%?No, the 10.1% is an average. Rate changes differ by product due to the impact of benefit changes. These average increases are:&bull; 10.1% for HMO plans&bull; 9.9% for POS plansThe exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, and the age and family size for enrolling employees.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of actions to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&bull; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have.

The manual rate was blended with actual Assurant Nevada specific experience (56% credible) to develop the base rate. Full credibility was determined to be achieved at 322,000 member months. Assurant removed Nevada specific experience when developing the manual rate to avoid double counting. The blended base rate decreased 10.5% from 2014. The same credibility formula was applied for the 2014 rate development.For the 2015 rate development, the base data was adjusted 1.106 to reflect expected changes in morbidity between the base and projected periods. In the 2014 rate development, an overall 2.0% morbidity adjustment was assumed. The morbidity factor was updated in 2015 based on an external study of the entire Nevada market versus an internal study performed to develop the 2014 rates.The ACA Health Insurer Fee increased from 1.2% to 1.7% of premium. State premium taxes, fees and assessments increased from 4.0% to 4.3% of premium. In addition, the PCORI impacted fees by 0.05%. There was no change to the impact of federal income taxes. The changes in taxes / fees resulted in a 0.55% change to premium. The change in the federal transitional reinsurance assessments between 2014 and 2015 resulted in a decrease of 0.9% to premium rates.The Federal MLR estimate is 80.0%, which does not include a credibility adjustment. It is assumed that without the credibility adjustment, this is a conservative estimate, and the actual MLR for purposes of determining any rebates due to consumers, will be higher. This compares to 80.0% calculated in 2014.  The reported profit margin is estimated to be 3% in 2015 and is unchanged from 2014.The 9.0% trend was developed using experience from Assurant&rsquo;s nationwide block of business. The trend was lowered to 9.0% from their small group three-year average of 9.3% as they anticipate a more standard risk population going forward. Assurant utilized a 9.0% trend factor in their 2014 filing.The reviews by Wakely Consulting and Nevada Division of Insurance focused on compliance with Chapters 689C and 686B of the Nevada Revised Statutes and the Health and Human Services Final Rate Review Regulation Part 154 Health Insurance Rate Increases: Disclosure and Review Requirements.Based on the reviews of the relevant items listed in Section 154.301 of the HHS Final Rate Review Regulation, it has been determined that a 16 percent rate increase is not unreasonable.

Therefore, the IID approved the WHPI filing.",Not Applicable,"URRT Part II Description of Requested Rate IncreaseWellmark Health Plan of IowaIndividual HealthEffective January 1, 2015Scope and Range of Rate IncreaseWellmark Health Plan of Iowa, Inc has 2,177 policyholders representing 3,212 members in individual Affordable Care Act, ACA, plans as of May 2014.  The requested average rate increase for all of these plans is 11.9%, and will be effective January 1, 2015. The rate increase varies by plan and region, with a low of 5.9% and a high of 17.5%.  Subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate changes will vary depending on the benefit plan selected, age of the members on the policy, and dependent coverage.Financial Experience of the ProductThese ACA plans were introduced in 2014, and so as of the time of this rate request, there is only a limited amount of experience data available.  Rates for 2015 were therefore based on experience from Wellmark&rsquo;s existing individual business, and projected member movement from the entire insured and uninsured population.From the little claims experience that was available at the time of this rate request, the claims experience is higher for this business than was projected last year.  Therefore the majority of the rate request is due to higher expected claims experience.The proposed rate increase is expected to produce a medical loss ratio, MLR, of 88.8%.  It should be noted that the projected MLR meets the minimum requirement of 80.0% defined in the ACA.  If the actual MLR were to fall below this level, such as if actual claim costs turn out to be lower than expected, Wellmark would pay rebates to members as required by the ACA.Changes in Medical Service CostsAnnual trend of 4.1% was used to project claims from the experience period into the rating period. This trend assumption includes any change in service costs and utilization. Multi year trend averages were reviewed to arrive at the assumed trend amount.Changes in BenefitsThere is one plan that has changes in its benefits effective with this filing for January 1, 2015.For SimplyBlue 5000 HMO, the coinsurance changed from 40% to 30% and the out of pocket amounts changed from $6,250 for single and $12,500 for family to $6,600 for single and $13,200 for family.  There are now any 2 office exam occurrences at a $0 copay instead of 2 primary care office exam occurrences at a $0 copay, and there is an inclusion of a drug card with a tier 1 copay of $15 instead of all drugs applying deductible and coinsurance.Administrative Costs and Anticipated ProfitsThe main drivers of administrative expenses are employee salaries and benefits, broker and agent commissions, and various governmental taxes and fees. We strive to lower our administrative expenses, as well as the underlying cost of care, in order to provide the best value to our customers.For this rate request, administrative costs in aggregate have decreased as a percent of premium from the prior rating period. The same holds for anticipated profit, as it was reduced from 3.3% in the prior rating period to 0.0% in the projected rating period.

This quarterly increase combined with previously filed increases yields an annual average increase of 8.8%.  A subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate could be higher or lower depending on the benefit plan selected, geographic location, and age characteristics.  It should be noted that the projected MLR of 81.0% for these small group plans, in total, exceeds the minimum MLR requirement of 80% as defined in the Affordable Care Act (ACA).Financial ExperienceAnthem expects the proposed rate increase to cover projected medical trends and to yield a medical loss ratio of 81.0% on an ACA basis, meaning at least eighty-one cents of each premium dollar are expected to go to covering medical expenses.  The projected medical trends used to determine the rates were certified to be reasonable by an independent actuarial firm.  The Affordable Care Act requires that no less than 80% of a health insurer&rsquo;s premium dollars go to medical expenses, otherwise a premium rebate to employers and subscribers must be generated to refund the difference.  Accordingly, Anthem is filing premium increases targeting compliance with that requirement.Changes in Medical CostsThe primary drivers of premium increases are associated with increases in the price of services primarily from hospitals and physicians, and cost of drugs, coupled with changes in consumption of services, also called&ldquo;utilization&rdquo;, by members.  Increases in the price of services can be driven by technology advances and cost shifting to private insurers from underfunded Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement.  Changes in utilization of services can be driven by benefit design and economic conditions.Administrative Costs and ProfitsAnthem continues to effectively manage administrative and selling costs.

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 14.3%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 7,627 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.For Product 65598KS007 current enrollment is 2,073. These members will have an approximate rate increase of 14.3%.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 7.3%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer individuals in Kansas a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes decreased expected medical costs by an average of 3.0%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&#61623;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&#61623; Changes to required taxes and fees&#61623; Phase-out of the Transtional Reinsurance Program which increases rates for plans issued to individualsWill Premiums for All Individuals Increase 14.3%?No, the 14.3% is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down. Others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the subscriber chooses, the number of members and their ages, where in Kansas the subscriber is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Individual business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Coventry's secure member portal, My Online Services, which was designed to empower our members to become more involved in their health care by allowing them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services. Additionally, Aetna&rsquo;s Plan for Your Health website aims to educate all consumers, not just Aetna and Coventry members, on how to take advantage of their health care benefits.",Review Complete,15.59,65598KS007,KS POS Individual Exchange,Coventry Health Care Of Kansas Inc,KANSAS,KS,Annual,15.59,15.59,RC

The rate increase requested is 5.45%.&bull;	Financial experience:  Experience under the products is not credible, with limited enrollment to date.  The rate increase is requested in part to reflect negative financial experience under other non-grandfathered small group business in Wisconsin (which is used as the base experience in the rate development) with medical expenditures higher than expected.&bull;	Changes in Medical Service Costs:  The increase was mainly driven by the expectation for future medical services costs.  US Health base claims costs increased, with high increases on hospital and pharmacy costs offset somewhat by lower increases on professional claims.  Early 2014 experience has shown additional increases in medical claim levels.&bull;	Changes in Benefits:  The benefits under the plans remain unchanged from the benefits associated with the current rates.  However, as medical costs increase, the share of costs paid by the plan will increase, due to the fixed nature of cost sharing such as deductibles.

(Wellmark) is requesting a 14.5% average rate increase, SERFF Tracking Number: WMIA-129623422, on all Individual Medical ACA Non HIX products, to be effective on January 1, 2015.Magnum Actuarial Group&rsquo;s review focused on the following:&bull;Determine whether the filing complies with HHS instructions and regulations&bull;Ensure the IDI took into consideration all of the issues required of an effective rate review&bull;Determine whether the proposed rates meet the HHS requirements for reasonableness, i.e. justified, non-discriminatory, and neither excessive nor inadequateWellmark provided all of the required information, including the URRT (Part I), Rate Increase Narrative (Part II), Actuarial Memorandum (Part III), and the IA assister file.We compared the current 2015 specific factors and assumptions utilized in the rate development to the values used in 2014, examined the methodology used to derive them, and reviewed the reasonableness of each factor and materiality of potential differences of opinion.  We found no instances where the assumptions or pricing factors were unreasonable or inconsistent with market reform implementation constraints and guidelines.  The development process of the index rate through the consumer adjusted index rate was compliant with the federal instructions and the calibrations are justifiable.The projected medical loss ratio was 88.9%, was calculated according to the federal instructions, and exceeds the minimum of 80%.We believe that the requested rate increase is not unreasonable.",Not Applicable,"URRT Part II Description of Requested Rate IncreaseWellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of IowaIndividual HealthEffective January 1 2015Scope and Range of Rate IncreaseWellmark Inc has 9360 policyholders representing 15062 members in individual Affordable Care Act ACA plans as of May 2014.  The requested average rate increase for all of these plans is 14.5%, and will be effective January 1 2015. The rate increase varies by plan and region, with a low of 6.4% and a high of 18.3%.  Subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate changes will vary depending on the benefit plan selected, age of the members on the policy, and dependent coverage.Financial Experience of the ProductThese ACA plans were introduced in 2014, and so as of the time of this rate request, there is only a limited amount of experience data available.  Rates for 2015 were therefore based on experience from Wellmark&rsquo;s existing individual business, and projected member movement from the entire insured and uninsured population.From the little claims experience that was available at the time of this rate request, the claims experience is higher for this business than was projected last year.  Therefore the majority of the rate request is due to higher expected claims experience.The proposed rate increase is expected to produce a medical loss ratio MLR of 88.9%.  It should be noted that the projected MLR meets the minimum requirement of 80.0% defined in the ACA.  If the actual MLR were to fall below this level such as if actual claim costs turn out to be lower than expected, Wellmark would pay rebates to members as required by the ACA.Changes in Medical Service CostsAnnual trend of 4.1% was used to project claims from the experience period into the rating period. This trend assumption includes any change in service costs and utilization. Multi year trend averages were reviewed to arrive at the assumed trend amount.Changes in BenefitsThere are three plans that have changes in their benefits effective with this filing for January 1, 2015.For CompleteBlue 3500 PPO the coinsurance changed from 40% to 30%, the out of pocket amounts changed from $6,250 for single and $12,500 for family to $6,600 for single and $13,200 for family, and the deductible of $250 was removed from the drug card along with changing the preferred specialty copay from $70 to $100.For myBlue HSA Silver 3200 PPO members now have benefits after the single deductible is met, and they no longer have to wait until the entire family deductible is met.For EnhancedBlue 1000 PPO  the preferred specialty copay for the drug card was changed from $70 to $100.Administrative Costs and Anticipated ProfitsThe main drivers of administrative expenses are employee salaries and benefits, broker and agent commissions, and various governmental taxes and fees. We strive to lower our administrative expenses, as well as the underlying cost of care, in order to provide the best value to our customers.For this rate request, administrative costs in aggregate have decreased as a percent of premium from the prior rating period. The same holds for anticipated profit, as it was reduced from 3.3% in the prior rating period to 0.0% in the projected rating period. Typically, a nominal margin is needed to help ensure Wellmark&rsquo;s long-term viability.",Review Complete,16.03,72160IA019,CompleteBlue,Wellmark Inc.,IOWA,IA,Annual,16.03,16.03,RC

The manual rate was blended with actual Assurant Nevada specific experience (56% credible) to develop the base rate. Full credibility was determined to be achieved at 322,000 member months. Assurant removed Nevada specific experience when developing the manual rate to avoid double counting. The blended base rate decreased 10.5% from 2014. The same credibility formula was applied for the 2014 rate development.For the 2015 rate development, the base data was adjusted 1.106 to reflect expected changes in morbidity between the base and projected periods. In the 2014 rate development, an overall 2.0% morbidity adjustment was assumed. The morbidity factor was updated in 2015 based on an external study of the entire Nevada market versus an internal study performed to develop the 2014 rates.The ACA Health Insurer Fee increased from 1.2% to 1.7% of premium. State premium taxes, fees and assessments increased from 4.0% to 4.3% of premium. In addition, the PCORI impacted fees by 0.05%. There was no change to the impact of federal income taxes. The changes in taxes / fees resulted in a 0.55% change to premium. The change in the federal transitional reinsurance assessments between 2014 and 2015 resulted in a decrease of 0.9% to premium rates.The Federal MLR estimate is 80.0%, which does not include a credibility adjustment. It is assumed that without the credibility adjustment, this is a conservative estimate, and the actual MLR for purposes of determining any rebates due to consumers, will be higher.

The dominant causes of the proposed rate increase of 17.3% consist of a projected aggregate annual claims trend of 7.9%, a 6.0% increase for population risk morbidity adjustment, and a 4.6% increase for dual option HMO/PPO adjustment. Aetna&rsquo;s proposed rate increase translates to a projected unadjusted loss ratio of about 71% compared to its 2013 experience loss ratio of about 77% for this block of business. The Department review of assumptions on which the proposed rate increase is based finds that the projected aggregate medical loss ratio of 78% will be less than the minimum federal MLR of 80%.ConclusionThe Department determined the proposed average annual rate increase of 17.3% by Aetna Health of California is unreasonable. The Department requested that Aetna lower the rate increase from 17.3% to 9.2%, which would have resulted in about $24 million in savings to small group employers who will be impacted by the rate increase. Aetna rejected this request and will be implementing its proposed rate increase beginning January 1, 2015.","We had discussions with the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) actuaries where we explained our assumptions and reasoning for our Q1 2015 Small Group HMO rate filing. We respectfully disagree with their conclusion that our rate increase is unreasonable.  The projected Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) for our entire Small Group block, which consists of both DMHC-filed HMO products and CDI-filed PPO products (which are  typically purchased with the HMO products), exceeds the federal requirement.  In order to ensure long-term viability of our Small Group business in California, we believe it is both appropriate and necessary to coordinate the pricing of all products offered to small employers, and to evaluate the MLR in total.  The rates we filed reflect what we believe is needed to cover the healthcare costs for the products our customers purchase, which is a combination of both HMO and PPO offerings.","SummaryAetna is filing rates for Small Group plans in California. This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 17.41%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through March 2015. Approximately 9500 members are expected to enroll in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 5.5% excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in California, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&#61623; The unit cost for an inpatient hospital admission increased 8.5%&#61623; Capitation amounts for inpatient hospital have increased 19.4%What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsIn our 2014 pricing, we assumed morbidity would increase by 0.85%, relative to pre&#8208;ACA experience. Based on emerging experience we have reevaluated our estimate and have revised it to 6%.We offer California small businesses a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes increased expected medical costs by an average of 0.78%.Will Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 17.41%?No, the 17.41% is an average. Rate changes differ by product due to the impact of benefit changes. These average increases are:&#61623; 17.42% for Product 20523CA003 with 857,274 projected member&#8208;months&#61623; 17.19% for Product 20523CA004 with 45,201 projected member&#8208;monthsSome premiums will increase by less than the average. Others will increase by more. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling employees, and where in California the group is located.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high&#8208;cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have.

The projected 2015 MLR after this proposed rate increase is 88.7 percent.The issuer did not sufficiently document some assumptions initially.  However, sufficient documentation and support was provided upon request. The requested increase was found to be reasonable and justified.  The choice of assumptions and the combination of assumptions upon which the rates are based are not unreasonable.",Not Applicable,"SummaryCoventry Health and Life Insurance Company (Coventry) is filing rates for Small Group plans in South Dakota. This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 15.53%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 22 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 11.8%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer individuals in South Dakota a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes decreased expected medical costs by an average of 4.39%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&bull;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&bull;	Changes to required taxes and feesWill Premiums for All Individuals Increase 15.53%?No, the 15.53% is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down, others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the subscriber chooses, the number of members and their ages, where in South Dakota the subscriber is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 85% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 85% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 85%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&bull;	Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull;	Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have.

DIFS utilized an independent actuary to perform a review of HealthPlus&rsquo;s filing.  The largest contributors to the rate increase were emerging adverse experience for 2014, the impact of transitional policies reducing the number of healthy people purchasing compliant ACA coverage, lower reinsurance recoveries for 2015, and annual trend in health costs.  The independent actuary found the rating methodology and assumptions to be appropriate and the resulting rates were derived consistent with both Federal and state laws.",Not Applicable,"The rate increase being requested for HealthPlus of Michigan Individual HMO products is 13.1 percent in aggregate. The requested rate increase varies by plan within the individual HMO product with a minimum increase of 6.0 percent and a maximum increase of 14.8 percent.  The biggest driver of the rate change is setting HPM's underlying claims morbidity to better reflect the 2015 individual single risk pool compared to 2014.  HPM's emerging experience in 2014 indicates higher costs than were expected in 2014 pricing, resulting in a paid loss ratio to date of near 100 percent. In addition, the presence of transitional policies has the effect of narrowing the pool of enrollees for coverage.  Transition policies are expected to have lower morbidity than ACA compliant policies since plans issued prior to January 1, 2014 were subject to medical underwriting, leaving a pool of potential enrollees for ACA-compliant plans that have higher morbidity than expected when developing 2014 premium rates.  Based on research and emerging HPM 2014 individual prescription drug claims data, we are finding that the individual populations have a costlier health status than what was projected for 2014.  Another driver of the rate change is due to the lower Federal reinsurance recoveries.  The recoveries assume in 2015 HPM will receive 50 percent of all HPM's individual members per member year incurred between $70,000 and $250,000. In 2014, rates were priced for recoveries to be 80 percent of claims between $60,000 and $250,00.",Review Complete,13.10,13667MI014,HMO Individual,HealthPlus of Michigan,MICHIGAN,MI,Annual,13.10,13.10,RC

The actual increase experienced by a group upon renewal will vary depending on the age and gender makeup of the group, their location, the group&rsquo;s current underwriting status, their current plan, and the Affordable Care Act compliant plan they choose to select upon renewal.  The ranges of impacts due to rate changes requested in this filing are as a result of the following parameters.Elimination of rating groups due to the health status of their members.Elimination of gender rating.Changes to allow no greater than a 3 to 1 difference in premium between adult ages 21 to 64, and prescribed adult and child age rating factors established by HHS.Implementation of single year age bands for adults 21 to 64.Changes to the method of rating to calculate group rates at a member level.  Elimination of composite rating and counting no more than three child dependents toward a family premium.Changes in the pricing values of specific benefit designs.New geographic pricing regions and updated geography pricing factors that no longer allow or make use of a region&rsquo;s overall health status in pricing.Groups that are on plans below the minimum allowed benefit level or that will need to move to a more generous level of plan cost sharing as a result of ACA requirements.Groups that need to move to new plan designs to remain within mandated ranges in benefit levels, for example, prescribed metal levels of benefits.The impact for groups will range from a 41 percent reduction to a 284 percent increase.  This does not reflect any impacts due to member aging, and is based on the sample of 2013 groups that have renewed with us through March of this year.  This includes required benefit changes.  Before the required changes, the largest increase would be 249 percent.  The ultimate range of impacts will vary depending on the profile of groups that will continue to renew throughout the year, or changes in the age make-up of our groups.This filing impacts 233,950 members currently enrolled in our Small Group market as of March 2013.Financial Experience for the ProductIn 2010, BCBSNC collected 1108.8 million in revenue and paid 919.0 million in claims for Small Groups.  The operating income before federal income tax was 22.7 million or 2 percent of revenue.In 2011, BCBSNC collected 1067.0 million in revenue and paid 883.0 million in claims for Small Groups.  The operating income before federal income tax was 29.5 million or 2.8 percent of revenue.In 2012, BCBSNC collected 1024.3 million in revenue and paid 837.2 million in claims for Small Groups.  The operating income before federal income tax was 38.1 million or 3.7 percent of revenue.The projected rate action is estimated to result in 1211.5 million in revenue based on current membership with anticipated paid claims of 966.3 million 2014.  We expect this rate action to deliver a 3 percent of gross revenue in contribution to surplus prior to federal income tax.  Favorable financial experience has allowed us to reduce premiums by .2 percent.Changes in Medical Service CostsThe cost of providing medical care to our members is by far the largest portion of premium expense.  The following changes in medical service costs and utilization contribute to the overall rate increase.Increases in both unit costs and utilization of knee and hip surgeries.Increases in outpatient costs per visit of 8.1 percent, driven primarily by gastroenterology costs and orthopedic costs.Increases in outpatient utilization of .8 percent, driven by chemical dependency services.Increases in professional costs of 2.5 percent, driven heavily by treatment of GERD and colonoscopies, and endocrinology treatments for obesity.Increases in professional utilization of 1.1 percent, due to increases in office visits, including mental health treatment.Increases in pharmacy costs per prescription of 2.1 percent due to increases in use of high cost, specialty medications.  Increases in specialty drug costs alone rose by 15.5 percent in 2012 compared to a decline in non specialty drug costs on a per member per month basis.In total, changes in the underlying cost of providing medical services to our current members add 7.1 percent to our rate increase.Changes in utilization patterns, primarily driven by the elimination of copayments once the member out of pocket maximum is reached, and the overall expected risk of our Small Group pool in 2014 add an additional 1.5 percent combined.Changes in BenefitsAdditional benefits will add 4.7 percent to the rate increase in 2014.BCBSNC has developed new plans to remain compliant with the Affordable Care Act.  These plans eliminate dollar limits on any essential health benefits and implement out of pocket maximiums that limit any type of member of out of pocket cost, including copayments, as required by law.  Furthermore, groups will need to move to a plan compliant with federally required ranges for plan cost sharing or actuarial value. Upon renewal,  groups will be presented a renewal with a default plan most comparable to their current plan.  Groups will have a choice of any plan offered in the market, however, the rate increase presented in this filing reflects the extimated overall impact of the change in premium including any required changes in benefit design, as described above.  The required changes in design add 3.5 percent to the rate increase.

These trend factors affect health insurance premiums, which can mean a premium rate increase to cover costs.  Some of the key health care cost trends that have affected this year&rsquo;s rate actions include:&#61607;	Increasing Cost of Medical Services&ndash; Annual increases in reimbursement rates to health care providers&ndash; such as hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical companies.&#61607;	Increased Utilization&ndash; The number of office visits and other services continues to grow.  In addition, total health care spending will vary by the intensity of care and use of different types of health services. Patients who are sicker generally have a higher intensity of health care utilization. The price of care can be affected by the use of expensive procedures such as surgery vs. simply monitoring or providing medications.&#61607;	Higher Costs from Deductible Leveraging&ndash; Health care costs continue to rise every year, while deductibles and copayments remain the same.  As a result, a greater percentage of health care costs need to be covered by health insurance premiums each year.&#61607;	Cost shifting from the public to the private sector&ndash; Reimbursements from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to hospitals are no longer covering all of the cost of care.  The cost difference is being shifted to private health plans. Additionally, Medicare and Medicaid rates to hospitals are expected to decline due to the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on Medicare and the effect of the recession on Medicaid.  A rate increase paid by Medicaid to hospitals is often below the actual cost increase hospitals will experience.&#61607;	Impact of New Technology - Improvements to medical technology and clinical practice require use of more expensive services - leading to increased health care spending and utilization.&#61607;	Underwriting Wear Off&ndash; The variation by policy duration in individual medical insurance claims, where claims are higher at later policy durations as more time has elapsed since initial underwriting.Changes in BenefitsThere have been no premium changes due to benefit changes in this filing.Administrative CostsGolden Rule Insurance Company works to directly control administrative expenses by adopting better processes and technology, and through the development of programs and innovations that make health care more affordable. We have led the marketplace by introducing key innovations that make health care services more accessible and affordable for customers, improve the quality and coordination of health care services, and help individuals and their physicians make more informed health care decisions.Additionally, Golden Rule indirectly controls medical cost payments by using appropriate payment structures with providers and facilities. Golden Rule&rsquo;s goal is to control costs, maximize efficiency, and work closely with physicians and providers to obtain the best value and coverage.In addition, increases in State and Federal government imposed taxation and fees are another significant factor that impacts health care spending.These fees include new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) taxes and fees which will increase health insurance costs and need to be reflected in premium.  The two largest cost impacts both take effect with calendar year 2014 earned premiums:&bull;	Insurer Fee: UnitedHealthcare estimates 2014 premium will need to be increased by 1.6% to cover this fee and the associated additional federal income tax.&bull;	Reinsurance Fee: UnitedHealthcare estimates 2014 premium will need to be increased by $5.25 per member per month.  This results in an increase for 2014 premium of 2.3%.A review of the current Golden Rule premium rate indicates that the rate is not sufficient to cover the benefit and administrative costs. The requested rate increase is anticipated to be sufficient to cover the projected benefit and administrative costs over the period beginning January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014.",Review Complete,11.00,26847TX015,Gen 25,Golden Rule Insurance Company,Texas,TX,Annual,11.00,11.00,RC

The loss ratio for the experience period was 90.7%, which exceeded our target loss ratio of 81.30%.

The loss ratio for the experience period was 140.4%. These products are at the top of the rating band range as prescribed by South Dakota regulation. Thus, the increase for these products will be the same as on the Blue Select products, which is 5.2%.For South Dakota Farm Bureau products, the base period of January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 had incurred claims of $590,776 and premium of $589,368. The loss ratio for the experience period was 100.2%. These products are at the top of the rating band range as prescribed by South Dakota regulation. Thus, the increase for these products will be the same as on the Blue Select products, which is 5.2%.Changes in Medical Service CostsAnnual trend of 8.0% was used to project claims from the experience period into the rating period. This trend assumption includes any change in service costs and utilization. Due to natural fluctuations in claims amounts within a relatively smaller book of business, multi-year trend averages were reviewed to arrive at the assumed trend amount.Changes in BenefitsBenefits for all products within this filing remained relatively stable from the base period, so no adjustments were made.Administrative Costs and Anticipated ProfitsWhile Wellmark administrative costs in aggregate have decreased as a percent of premium from the prior rating period, additional ACArelated fees and impacts will now have to be factored into the premiums.

The difference between 17.4 percent and 30.5 percent is caused by rate changes that took place between January 1, 2013 and October 1, 2013.This rate increase is being caused by many factors, most of them related to the requirements of the Affordable Care Act that are becoming effective in 2014.

These federal ACA requirements add costs to all consumers&rsquo; commercial health plans for 2014.Golden rule is including 0% margin for profits (after tax) into these rates for 2014. Thus they are pricing this block of business at a break-even level for 2014.These rate filings are only for the Non-Grandfathered (NGF) members enrolled on these plans.Grandfathered (GF) members enrolled on these plans have not yet received any approved rate increase for 2014. The prior rate filings (280386, 280387) requesting a 28.0% rate increase including GF members for the period November 2013 through October 2014 was not approved. The Division requested that Golden Rule split out GF members into their own rate filing going forward.These plans do not include members enrolled on Golden Rule&rsquo;s F.A.C.T. Association Group plans in Colorado. F.A.C.T. members have not yet received any rate increase for 2014.Golden Rule has submitted some documents in this filing as being&ldquo;Confidential&rdquo;, meaning that they are included in the filing to support the rate increase, but they are not available for public view.The Optional enhanced Supplemental Accident Benefit is receiving a 14.3% increase.Rate MethodologyThe CMM and H&amp;S products in this filing are being pooled for rate setting purposes.Experience Used for Rate Setting: Golden Rule included 3.5 years of experience for these NGF plans, from January 2010 through June 2013. The most recent 12 month incurred experience period used as the base in the projection calculation was July 2012 through June 2013:NGF Experience: 71.2% Loss Ratio based on an average of 17,377 covered lives.Golden Rule also provided the Federal Uniform Rate Review Template (URRT) which must accompany Individual NGF filings and be reported in HIOS. The URRT is not required for GF member filings and does not contain GF member experience. In the URRT Golden Rule provides experience for the 2012 calendar year period for NGF members. This 2012 NGF experience is also provided in the Colorado actuarial memorandum. The Federal URRT is not the official rating development or calculation. Rather it represents a standardized projected average premium calculation that is used by CMS for comparing and gauging premium development and rate changes. Following is a comparison of the 2012 experience in the URRT and in the Actuarial Memorandum.URRT:2012 NGF Experience: 67.0% Loss Ratio based on an average of 15,252 lives.Actuarial Memorandum:2012 NGF Experience: 67.4% Loss Ratio based on an average of 15,134 covered lives.Annual Health Cost Pricing Trend: 8.0%.Golden Rule submitted 4 years of Nationwide quarterly claim trend data split separately for Medical and Pharmacy. The data shows historical trends as well as normalized trends adjusted for demographic and benefit changes from period to period.2012 Medical Normalized Historic Trend: 7.7%2012 Pharmacy Normalized Historic Trend: 8.29%The 8.0% pricing trend falls in line with the normalized historic data. Note that commercial Individual claims trends may differ from general cost index increases due to cost sharing leveraging effects and other factors specific to a block of business and product type. The 8% pricing trend proposed by Golden Rule falls within the middle range of Individual business trends being used in 2014 in the Colorado Individual insurance market.Experience Consistency: The Division reviewed the reported loss ratios in specific quarters and periods:67.4% Loss Ratio for the 2012 experience period.66.5% Loss Ratio for the 1st. Half of 2013 experience period.71.2% Loss Ratio for the July 2012 to June 2013 experience period.The question was addressed as to why the loss ratio for the period from July 2012 through June 2013 could be larger than the loss ratio for the other two overlapping periods. The Division was able to verify that this data is correct and does not represent an error, it results from the fact that the 1st Half 2012 had a lower loss ratio than 1st half 2013. The first half of the year tends to be the lower due to seasonality, and the loss ratios from year to year have tended to increase as the block of business has matured and average policy duration has increased. Both of these are normal developments.Projection Calculation: Golden Rule provided a detailed projection calculation showing monthly premium and claims for both the experience period (July 2012&ndash; June 2013) and the new rating period (February 2014&ndash; December 2014). This calculation was submitted as being confidential. The projected loss ratios with and without the 13% proposed rate increases were:Experience Period Loss ratio: 71.4%Projected Loss Ratio Without Rate Increases: 87.5%Projected Loss Ratio With Rate Increases: 78.3%Target Loss Ratio Based on Needed Retention: 78.3%The increase from the experience period loss ratio of 71.4% to the projected rating period loss ratio of 87.5% (without rate increase) is primarily driven by 18 months of expected claims trend at 8% annual, and additional uwwo trend that Golden Rule is applying. Golden Rule provided as&ldquo;confidential&rdquo; some of the support for how their uwwo factors were developed. Based on an objection submitted from the Division, Golden Rule has now modified the impact of the uwwo factor from what was originally filed by building in an assumption that some older and sicker members will be more likely to move to an ACA Exchange plan in the 1st quarter of 2014. The average member duration through the projected period has been decreased to reflect this.Golden Rule has ceased to sell these plans to any new members commencing on January 1, 2014, because this is block of business is not ACA compliant for 2014. Golden rule did not file an ACA compliant block of business for 2014 in Colorado.Golden Rule is proposing rate increases in this filing to continue for NGF members through December 31, 2014, and has reflected this in their projections by assuming NGF members may stay on their plans throughout 2014 if they wish. This results in Golden Rule applying larger uwwo increases to claims projections for 2014 because these NGF members then have large uwwo factors accumulating throughout 2014. Since Golden Rule may not sell any new plans in 2014 the average plan duration increases throughout 2014.We reviewed the estimated reserves built into final claims for Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) claims. Levels for estimated IBNR claims were moderate and well within accepted levels for these benefit and product types.Premium Retained to Cover Expenses, Taxes Fees and ProfitsAdministrative costs: Expenses the insurance company pays to operate this insurance plan.This includes all expenses not directly related to paying claims, such as, but not limited to, salaries of company employees, the cost of the company&rsquo;s offices and equipment, commissionsto agents to sell and service policies, subsidies to cover legally required plans such as portability, and taxes.Profit: The amount of money remaining after claims and administrative expenses are paid. Margin is the comparable term for a nonprofit insurance company.For 2014 Golden Rule is requesting 0% profit levels after income tax, which is 0.9% profit before income tax.Additional federal ACA taxes and assessments have been imposed on issuers for 2014. These additional taxes and assessments imposed by the federal government have increased premiums for all consumers on commercial health plans in 2014. Golden Rule has proposed keeping 4.025% of member&rsquo;s premiums to cover these taxes. This includes the typical $5.25 pmpm to cover Transitional Reinsurance program fees, and 1.6% to cover the federal Health Insurer Fee (HIF). These levels are typical to what other issuers are collecting from members. Without the additional taxes and fees Golden Rule&rsquo;s retention level would only be 17.7%.Total average premium retention is 21.7% shown as follows:% of PremiumA.

The Division asked Golden Rule for the impact of these members leaving in their projection. Golden Rule modified their projections and indicated the following:&ldquo;In order to model the higher cost members moving to an ACA compliant plan in 2014, we have modified our projection to apply the shock lapse to our highest duration members. Members at lower durations generally have lower claims due to underwriting. Thus, we have applied our additional shock lapse only to those members at the highest durations to simulate members with higher claims moving to an ACA compliant plan in 2014.&rdquo;The Division previously objected to the large claims adjustment that increases the estimated cost of members in these plans. Golden Rule has made support for the large claims adjustment confidential in this filing. This adjustment has now been reduced in the final projection in comparison to what was submitted in prior filings.Golden Rule was able to address all other Division objections from this filing, and prior disapproved filings.Disapproved Rate ChangesThe Division has approved the 13.0% rate increase and all modified rate adjustments as noted in the Rate Change Summary section above.The Division is reviewing letters for the rate increase under state tracking 282459.

Some of the key health care cost trends that have affected this year&rsquo;s rate actions include:- Increasing Cost of Medical Services:  Annual increases in reimbursement rates to health care providers&ndash; such as hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical companies.- Increased Utilization: The number of office visits and other services continues to grow.  In addition, total health care spending will vary by the intensity of care and use of different types of health services. Patients who are sicker generally have a higher intensity of health care utilization. The price of care can be affected by the use of expensive procedures such as surgery vs. simply monitoring or providing medications.- Higher Costs from Deductible Leveraging: Health care costs continue to rise every year, while deductibles and copayments remain the same.  As a result, a greater percentage of health care costs need to be covered by health insurance premiums each year.- Cost shifting from the public to the private sector: Reimbursements from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to hospitals are no longer covering all of the cost of care.  The cost difference is being shifted to private health plans. Additionally, Medicare and Medicaid rates to hospitals are expected to decline due to the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on Medicare and the effect of the recession on Medicaid.  A rate increase paid by Medicaid to hospitals is often below the actual cost increase hospitals will experience.- Impact of New Technology: Improvements to medical technology and clinical practice require use of more expensive services - leading to increased health care spending and utilization.- Underwriting Wear Off: The variation by policy duration in individual medical insurance claims, where claims are higher at later policy durations as more time has elapsed since initial underwriting.Changes in BenefitsThere have been no premium changes due to benefit changes in this filing.Administrative CostsGolden Rule Insurance Company works to directly control administrative expenses by adopting better processes and technology, and through the development of programs and innovations that make health care more affordable. We have led the marketplace by introducing key innovations that make health care services more accessible and affordable for customers, improve the quality and coordination of health care services, and help individuals and their physicians make more informed health care decisions.Additionally, Golden Rule indirectly controls medical cost payments by using appropriate payment structures with providers and facilities. Golden Rule&rsquo;s goal is to control costs, maximize efficiency, and work closely with physicians and providers to obtain the best value and coverage.In addition, increases in State and Federal government imposed taxation and fees are another significant factor that impacts health care spending. These fees include new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) taxes and fees which will increase health insurance costs and need to be reflected in premium.  The two largest cost impacts both take effect with calendar year 2014 earned premiums:- Insurer Fee: UnitedHealthcare (parent company of Golden Rule Insurance Company) estimates 2014 premium will need to be increased by 1.625% to cover this fee and the associated additional federal income tax.- Reinsurance Fee: A value of $5.25 per member per month has been determined per HHS regulation for 2014 reinsurance fees.  For this product in the state of Colorado, this equates to approximately 2.4% of premium over the 2014 rating period.A review of the current Golden Rule premium rate indicates that the rate is not sufficient to cover the benefit and administrative costs. The requested rate increase is anticipated to be sufficient to cover the projected benefit and administrative costs over the period beginning January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014.",Review Complete,13.00,41341CO016,EX - Copay Select,Golden Rule Insurance Company,Colorado,CO,Annual,13.00,13.00,RC

The key drivers of the rate increases are medical trend, morbidity, and the change in the reinsurance expected recoveries. The projected medical trend for the block is about 9.4%. Coventry provided historical trend information that shows trends as high as 13%.

We have reviewed the calculation and find it reasonable.Coventry has provided sufficient support for their assumptions and rating methodology. We find the rate increase requested not unreasonable.",Not Applicable,"SummaryCoventry Health and Life Insurance Company (CHL) is filing rates for Individual PPO plans in Illinois. This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 10.6%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 4,000 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 9.4%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer individuals in Illinois a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes increased expected medical costs by an average of 1.8%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&middot;&ldquo;Keep What You Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in plans covered by this filing&middot; Changes to required taxes and fees&middot; Phase-out of the Transtional Reinsurance Program which increases rates for plans issued to individualsWill Premiums for All Individuals Increase 10.6%?No, the 10.6% is an average. Rate changes differ by product due to the impact of benefit changes.

The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the subscriber chooses, the age and family size for enrolling members, where in Illinois the subscriber is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Individual business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actualMLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&middot; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&middot; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access My Online Services, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services.

(NAIC code number 55107) has applied to the Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services to adjust premium rates for its community-rated small group and individual qualified health plans.I. OVERVIEWThe rates being sought contain a zero percent operating margin for the health plan despite the health plan reporting operating losses in 2013 and a forecasted significant operating loss in 2014. The proposed rate adjustment is based on the need to adjust prospectively from the state&rsquo;s reduction of rates by 6.3% on small group qualified health plans and by 4.0% on individual qualified health plans for 2014, an increasing medical cost trend, and changes in the health insurance market driven by federal and state actions. Other contributing factors for the proposed 2015 rate adjustment include increases in fees, taxes and added coverage for new mandated benefits.Excellus Health Plan and related companies (EHP) provide health insurance and administrative services for about 1.8 million upstate New Yorkers in 39 counties. The proposed premium rates affect about 182,000 members or 10% of the health plan&rsquo;s total membership. Its proposed rates are subject to review by the New York Department of Financial Services pursuant to section 4308c of the New York Insurance Law. The Department may approve the proposed rate increase as requested, modify the proposed rate increase, or disapprove the proposed rate increase in its entirety. The determination by the Department shall be supported by sound actuarial assumptions and methods.The rate application will be filed with the Department on or about June 13, 2014. The actual rate increases approved by the Department will be communicated to the impacted parties at least 60 days prior to the date the new rate is implemented for the subscriber. EHP policyholders with renewal dates during 2015 would, if approved, receive the indicated rate adjustments on their next anniversary date on or after January 1, 2015.Excellus Health Plan is required by New York State law to develop rates that assume that at least 82% of premium revenue will be spent on health care costs in the direct pay market along with small groups, be actuarially sound, cover all claim costs, and provide a contribution to ensure adequate reserves. The percent of premium attributable to claims is referred to as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).Excellus Health Plan's MLR has been and continues to exceed the statutory minimums. In 2013, the MLR for Excellus Health Plan was 94.2% for individual direct pay and 91.0% for small groups. Under new reporting requirements for 2014, the three-year cumulative MLR is 94.4% for individual direct pay and 91.5% for small group qualified health plans. With the proposed rate adjustments, Excellus Health Plan's MLRs would remain well above the minimum levels. In the event the MLR falls below the required minimum, the health plan refunds any difference to policyholders.Periodic rate adjustments are necessary to secure the ability of Excellus Health Plan, or any insurer, to produce sufficient revenue and surplus for reserves to assure continued coverage and claim payments both for current health care needs, and potential catastrophic cost situations. Excellus Health Plan's reserves vary from year to year based on actual health care costs incurred. As of Dec. 31, 2013, the health plan had reserves equivalent to 2.5 months of claims and operating expense, and more than the minimum required by New York State law. These reserves are the insurance that assures payment even when costs run higher than anticipated, or emergencies or disasters occur, and should not be used as an alternative fund to temporarily reduce rate adjustments.In filing its rate application, Excellus Health Plan is sensitive to the fact that individuals and small businesses struggle to afford higher premiums. However, it is clear that an increase in premiums is necessary to assure the continued operations of the Plan and the viability of its product offerings. Because EHP already has a high MLR, failure to approve these rates would only lead to the need for even greater rate increases in the future as claim costs would eventually exceed premiums collected.II. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASEEscalating health care costsThe cost of health care services, equipment and products continues to be the primary reason for rate increases.Trend is a very important consideration in determining the need for a premium rate adjustment. Upstate New York is not immune to national trends in health care costs given our state&rsquo;s population and demographics. Industry experts such as Segal Consulting and Buck Consultants are forecasting a 7.2-10.4% medical benefit trend nationwide for 2014. EHP is forecasting an overall medical benefit trend factor for its commercial fully insured business of 6.8% for 2014-2015. The trend forecast takes into account projected increases in costs attributed to what Excellus Health Plan pays out in claims expenses for hospital inpatient and outpatient care, professional services, pharmacy benefits and other goods and services. The health plan&rsquo;s anticipated changes in medical benefit spending are summarized as follows:Hospital inpatient, 6.9%Hospital outpatient, 6.4%Professional services, 4.5%Pharmacy, 10.6%Other medical goods and services, 7.5%These trends do not include adjustments to base rates for previous rate increases that were insufficient to cover claims and operating expenses for some plan options.Health care costs for each of those benefit components take into account the compounding effects of both the price of the goods or services provided as well as the quantity of the goods and services consumed.The impact that each trend has to the overall cost of coverage is related to proportionate size of the benefit component. For example, overall spending would rise faster as a result of a 5% increase in professional services versus a 5% increase in drug costs because professional services represents a larger share of medical benefit spending.III. NEW YORK TAXES AND ASSESSMENTSInsurance taxes are built into the costs of health coverage. New Yorkers who voluntarily purchase private health insurance coverage paid more than $4 billion in state health taxes in 2011, according to an analysis by the New York State Conference of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans.New York&rsquo;s Health Care Reform Act of 1996 (HCRA) created two surcharges on health insurance and an additional tax is imposed under Section 206 (formerly Section 332) of the state Insurance Law.The covered lives assessment is an annual flat surcharge or tax on every person who has insurance coverage in the state. Health plans are assessed on the basis of the number of people they cover with individual and family rates that vary depending on the residence of the insured. Among upstate regions defined by the state, the annual covered lives assessment rates in 2014 that impact Excellus Health Plan members are as follows:Per Certificate Per Year by region (Individual : Family)Western: $39.40: $130.03Rochester: $105.72: $348.87Central: $55.59: $183.46Utica-Watertown: $8.54: $28.17Northeastern: $39.94: $131.79The second surcharge created by the 1996 Health Care Reform Act is collected from health plans in the form of a sales tax on many hospital-related services. The surcharge is applied to both self-insured and fully insured plans. Beginning at 8.18% in 1997, the surcharge is now at 9.63%.The third levy, the Section 206 assessment, was originally established to finance New York State Department of Insurance operations but its funding purposes have expanded beyond that purpose. The assessments apply to all licensed insurers in the state (e.g. life, property and casualty, and health), and are based on New York premiums.In total, the above New York taxes and assessments including Section 206 aggregated to nearly 6% of the 2015 small group and individual qualified health plans&rsquo; premium.IV. FEDERAL TAXES, MANDATES AND ADJUSTMENTSAnnual fee on health insurance providers:Beginning in 2014, this fee is based on each health insurance company&rsquo;s market share of net premiums written, adjusted for size and corporate structure.The federal law requires the total fee on nationwide health insurance providers to be collected is:$8 billion in 2014,$11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016,$13.9 billion in 2017, and$14.3 billion in 2018.After 2018, the fee is expected to collect $14.3 billion, indexed to the rate of growth in premiums.Each year, the calculation will be based on the market share of each assessed plan and will change based on the number of companies in the insured market. Under this fee provision, a health plan could incur financial losses but would still be subject to the market share fee.For EHP, this fee increase represents a 1.2% increase to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans for 2015.Risk Adjustment Program:The risk adjustment program is a permanent provision that applies to both the individual and small group insurance market. This federal program assesses a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and uses the revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members.A fee of $0.96 per member per year is collected to fund the risk adjustment program. For EHP, this program reduces small group qualified health plans&rsquo; premiums by about 1.5%. For 2015, this program has no impact on the premium of individual direct pay qualified health plans.Transitional reinsurance program for the individual market:The federal law created a temporary reinsurance program that is to collect nationwide:$10 billion in 2014,$6 billion in 2015, and$4 billion in 2016.Additionally, a separate contribution is to be deposited into the U.S. Treasury that will total $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016.The contribution rate is to be based on a $44 national per capita yearly amount in 2015. All insurers and self- insured group health plans are required to contribute on behalf of all group health plans and health insurance coverage they provide. For EHP, this fee represents about 1% of premium but it is about 40% less than last year resulting in a 0.5% decrease to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans in 2015.For the individual qualified health plans, the federal government established reinsurance for excessive claims. The amount of money being distributed in 2014 is being reduced in 2015. At the same time, this reduction will require a 3.8% premium increase for individual qualified health plans.Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) fee:The federal law created the PCORI to help stakeholders make informed health decisions by advancing the quality and relevance of evidence-based medicine through the use of comparative clinical effectiveness research findings. The fee is set at $2 per year multiplied by the average number of lives covered under the plan for plan years ending before October 1, 2014. And, for plan years ending on or after October 1, 2014, the fee increases based on the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures.Federal mental health mandateThe federal requirements for coverage of mental health parity require a 0.2% increase to current premium to pay for required benefits in 2015.V. OPERATING EXPENSE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTSA portion of what is reported to the state as administrative expenses is attributed to what Federal Health Reform considers quality improvement expenses, meaning the federal government recognizes that these represent costs that lead to overall improvements in health care versus simply a routine business expense, and as a result will be considered a medical benefit expense for purposes of federal MLR calculations.Those quality improvement expenses include such items as:-Improvements in health outcomes brought about by case management and disease management programs,-Actions taken to help prevent hospital readmissions through such things as discharge planning and counseling,-Wellness and community health promotional activities, and-Health information technology that is used to help measure clinical effectiveness and predictive modeling.The proposed rates will more accurately reflect the true operating expense of administering the federal Health Care Reform legislation through the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange. The changes in the health insurance market required building and implementing an entirely new sales channel from what had primarily been a business-to-business marketplace.This required:-The implementation of a new sales call center that saw extended open enrollment deadlines in 2014,-The hiring of additional staff,-Increased direct-to-consumer communication costs to educate consumers about new products and how to access those products, and-The building and implementation of new products, new infrastructure for the continued improvements and changes to the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange and for the implementation of additional mandates for the federal Health Care Reform.Operating expenses - including quality improvement initiatives but excluding federal and state taxes, fees and assessments, and broker commissions - represent 8.7% of premium in small group qualified health plans and 8.4% in individual qualified health plans.VI. REGULATION 146Regulation 146 was a market stabilization mechanism for the individual and small group pools that was in effect prior to the adoption of the ACA. Similar to the ACA Risk Adjustment program, Reg. 146 attempted to equalize the risk within the small group and individual markets by assessing a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and used this revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members. Because of the redundancy with the new risk adjustment program, Reg. 146 is being phased out. The Department of Financial Services is requiring plans to distribute all outstanding compensations through premium adjustments in 2015 and 2016. This distribution plan results in a reduction in the small group qualified health plan premium of 0.3% and in individual premium of about 1%.",Review Complete,12.20,78124NY111,Healthy New York,"Excellus Health Plan, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Quarterly,17.00,17.00,RC

SCOPE AND RANGE OF RATE INCREASEThe purpose of this memorandum is to justify a rate increase for Health Republic Insurance Company (HRIC) individual standard product in Oregon with effective dates of January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015.This justification is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 2794 of the Public Health Service Act as added by Section 1003 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).  This justification may not be appropriate for purposes or scopes beyond those described above and, therefore, should not be used for other purposes.This letter specifically addresses the rate increase requested for HRIC&rsquo;s individual Oregon standard product which impacts 570 members.  The rate increase being requested for HRIC&rsquo;s individual standard product is 10.5% in aggregate.  The requested rate increase varies by plan within the product with a minimum increase of 9.7% and a maximum increase of 11.0%.  Please note the initial 2015 proposed rate increase was -0.9% and the final implemented rate increase was 10.5%.The key drivers impacting the rate change are as follows:&#61607;	Medical and prescription drug trend,&#61607;	Reduction in impact of federal transitional reinsurance recoveries,&#61607;	Changes in demographic and geographic mix,&#61607;	Increases in administrative expenses, and&#61607;	The expected profit target change made, to be in compliance with the rates approved by the Oregon Insurance Department (OID).2.	FINANCIAL EXPERIENCEHRIC was new to the market in 2014, therefore HRIC has no prior experience.3.	CHANGES IN MEDICAL SERVICE COSTS AND TREND ASSUMPTIONSManual rates were trended forward to a January 1, 2015 effective date assuming an aggregate annualized allowed charge trend of 4%.  These trends were estimated based on conversations with HRIC senior management, Milliman research, general industry knowledge, and our judgment of recent trends.4.	CHANGES IN BENEFITSThe OID did not alter the benefit design of the Oregon standard plans, so there is no impact from benefit changes.5.	ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED PROFITSThe projected loss ratio calculated using the ACA definition is 88.7% excluding credibility adjustments since Oregon does not recognize federal credibility standards in the calculation of the Federal MLR.  This loss ratio allows for total health plan administrative costs and anticipated profits. HRIC&rsquo;s administrative expenses (as a percent of premium) increased roughly 1 percentage point when compared to the 2014 filing.  Anticipated after-tax margin increased from -3% (i.e., a loss) in 2014 to -1% in 2015.",Review Complete,10.48,96383OR001,Oregon Standard Plan,"Freelancers Consumer Operated and Oriented Program of Oregon, Inc.

The actuarial memorandum included, inter alia, actuarial assumptions, anticipated loss ratios, other information required by the ACA and appropriate actuarial certifications.INS has reviewed the submission in its entirety. However, INS has given special consideration in its review to the details of the Company&rsquo;s Part III Actuarial Memorandum, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template and the characteristics of the rating elements subject to the Federal regulations prescribed in 45CFR Part 147 paragraph 147.102.  Based on that review, INS has come to the following key conclusions:URRT Section 1 Experience Period Data&bull;	Earned premiums, incurred claims, allowed claims and index rate per member per month (PMPM) for the experience period, January 2013 through December 2013, appear reasonable,&bull;	The completion method used to determine estimated incurred claims and allowed claims is consistent with accepted actuarial methods,&bull;	BCBSTN does not anticipate having a MLR rebate based on its 2013 experience,&bull;	Member months for the Experience Period, 709,013 is expected to increase to 2,825,484 for the Projection Period. The company anticipates the large increase because:1.	BCBSTN believes a large number of previously uninsured individuals will enter the marketplace2.

Risk adjustment calculates a risk score for each plan participant, based upon age, sex and diagnosis. This is used to calculate the company&rsquo;s Plan average risk score. If the Plan average risk score is higher than the average risk score for the state, the Company will receive payment for having a higher risk population. Because BCBSTN anticipates its market level risk scores to be consistent with the Tennessee market, its Risk Adjustment is 0. However, due to changes in the URRT instructions for 2015, the $.08 Risk Adjustment Fee appears as -.08 on the Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM line in Worksheet 1, Section III of the URRT&bull;	The assumptions and methods used to determine the&lsquo;Projected ACA reinsurance recoveries, net of reinsurance premium, PMPM of $19.33 appear reasonable and consistent with accepted actuarial practice&bull;&lsquo;Administrative Expense Load&rsquo; and&lsquo;Taxes&amp; Fees&rsquo; appear reasonable for the Individual market.

Therefore, it appears to INS that the proposed average rate increase of 19% is actuarially reasonable. INS shares the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance (Department) concerns regarding the magnitude of the proposed average rate increase, which is larger than the overwhelming majority of rate increases INS has reviewed this year for implementation in 2015. However, INS also has concerns with the developing 2014 experience, which appears to be worse than expected for the six month period. Please note that the 90%+ Loss Ratio through June, 2014 most likely will fluctuate, as it contains only 6 months of experience. The bottom line is that it is difficult to predict at this point the fully developed 2014 Loss Ratio. Limiting the rate increase could lead to BCBSTN requesting an even larger rate increase in the 2015 filing for implementation in 2016.",Not Applicable,"Part II&ndash; Written Explanation of the Rate IncreaseBCBST is requesting a rate increase of 19.0%.  The majority of the rate increase being requested is due to higher than expected morbidity in the first few months of 2014 for the BCBST Marketplace and Non-Marketplace plans, increases in underlying medical cost due to inflation in the cost of medical services, as well as increased utilization of medical services and a reduction in anticipated payments from the Federal Transitional Reinsurance Program. Morbidity being higher than anticipated accounts for 9% of the rate increase.  Increases in underlying medical cost account for an additional 9% of the rate increase, and reduction in anticipated reinsurance payments account for the remaining 1%. Administrative costs are not contributing to the increase BCSBT is able to achieve economies of scale that prevent administrative cost from contributing to the rate increase. Benefits for this product are not changing therefore there is no rate increase for benefit changes.  BCBST does not anticipate making a gain on this product in 2015.As of June 21, 2014 the Marketplace and Non-Marketplace plans had 152,760 members who will be impacted by the rate increase if they elect to renew in 2015. Member increases will range between 6.1% and 21.7% before the impact of advance premium tax credits. The increase a member will see will vary according to their region and network. This variation is due to implementation of requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Individuals will also see an additional increase due to aging. For example, a 49 year-old who will turn 50 prior to January 1 2015 may see an additional 4.7% increase due to changing from the age 49 rates to the age 50 rates.The Marketplace and Non-Marketplace products are new products that were first introduced in January 2014 therefore no historical financial experience exists for these products.",Review Complete,18.94,14002TN034,Marketplace Gold,BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee,TENNESSEE,TN,Annual,18.94,18.94,RC

427126,88102,Individual,ST,01/01/2015,false,10/03/2014,11/12/2014,Not Unreasonable,"The State of Minnesota found the comments above regarding the small group morbidity to be confusing and asked for the carrier to provide more detailed information on the rate change for this narrative. Below is the revised Part 2 narrative provided by the carrier:&quot;This letter specifically addresses the rate increase requested for PICs individual product which impacts 81,437 members. The rate increase being requested for PICs individual product is 55.5 percent in aggregate. The requested rate increase varies by plan within the product with a minimum increase of 39.1 percent and a maximum increase of 93.6 percent. Please note the initial 2014 proposed rate increase was 85.3 percent and the final implemented rate increase was 17.2 percent.A number of items were considered when developing the premium rates, including but not necessarily limited to changes in the following itemsa. Projected morbidity level of the population anticipated to purchase the plans,b. Anticipated medical trend, both utilization and cost of services,c. Applicable taxes and fees, including those applicable in 2015 under ACA,d. Anticipated risk adjustment payments receipts, ande. Anticipated contributions to the Federal Transitional Reinsurance Program.Premium rates for the individual products were developed using PICs 2013 small group non grandfathered experience adjusted for demographic differences with the individual market, in conjunction with internal research proprietary to Milliman and other industry studies and surveys. One of the biggest driver of the rate change is setting PICs underlying claims morbidity similar to the small group morbidity level. We used PICs small group allowed claims from 2013 as the basis for claim development for the individual product. Based on research and emerging PIC 2014 individual claims data, we are finding that individual exchange populations have health status similar to historical small group books of business. Further, PIC has worked with outside consultants to estimate the risk adjustment payment or receipt due in 2015. Even with the risk adjustments, PIC exhibits experience very similar to small groupAnother driver of the rate change is due to the lower Federal reinsurance recoveries. The recoveries assume in 2015 PIC will receive 50 percent of all PICs individual members per member per year incurred claims between 70,000 and 250,000. In 2014, rates were priced for recoveries to be 80 percent of claims between 60,000 and 250,000.1. FINANCIAL EXPERIENCEPICs financial experience for individual products is displayed in Table 1 below.

These trends were estimated based on data from PIC, conversations with PIC senior management, Milliman research, general industry knowledge, and our judgment of recent trends.3. CHANGES IN BENEFITSPIC changed the maximum out of pocket MOOP for the catastrophic plans in 2015 to 6,600 from 6,350. In addition, deductible levels have been changed for some plans in order to maintain compliance with metal tier requirements after the application of AV adjustments requested by the MN Department of Commerce, PIC will also be offering one new bronze plan and one new network in 2015. We increased the baseline data by 4.6 percent, which is our estimate of the cost of covering benefits to meet the Essential Health Benefits EHB standard.

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED PROFITSPIC targets a federally prescribed medical loss ratio of 88.3 percent for its individual block of business. The loss ratio as calculated in accordance with Minnesota State law which includes taxes and fees is 97.1 percent. This loss ratio allows for total health plan administrative costs and anticipated profits. PICs administrative expenses as a percent of premium decreased roughly 6 percent when compared to the 2014 filing. Anticipated after tax margin increased from negative 2.5 percent in 2014 to .5 percent in 2015.&quot;More comments from state:The revised narrative above points out that the small group morbidity provided a better basis for morbidity than their own individual market experience from 2013 and before. This morbidity basis change is acceptable because 1) adjustments were made by the carrier's actuarial staff and consultants to reflect the demographic and plan design selection differences between the small group and individual market participants, and 2) the carrier's own 2013 (and earlier) individual market experience has been adequately demonstrated to state regulators to have been a poor basis for predicting the claims that this carrier will experience after January 1, 2014. Despite the high increase in last year's rates (17.2%) and the conservative risk adjustment and reinsurance receipts that this carrier had assumed for 2014 rating, this carrier had very competitive rates and has also experienced much anti-selection. All carriers are unsure of how the risk adjustment program will compensate for such anti-selection, since they do not yet know what their statewide competitors have experienced. The unique guarantee renewal rules in MN preclude this carrier from removing plans going forward that have contributed to anti-selection, such as platinum plans.",Not Applicable,"HIOS Part II Preliminary Justification&ndash; Written Explanation of Rate IncreasePreferredOne Insurance CompanyIndividual Product in MinnesotaJanuary 1, 2015 through December 31, 20151.

The Department therefore finds the proposed increase to be not unreasonable.,Not Applicable,"Scope and Range:Highmark Inc. is requesting an average premium increase of 20.8% (ranging from 14.9% to 21.9%) for its 2015 ACA-qualifying small group products with effective dates from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015.The extension of pre-ACA (transitional) policies, as announced by HHS on March 5, 2014, allows most small groups to keep their existing (non-ACA compliant) plans beyond 2015.  Lower cost small groups are expected to remain outside the ACA single-risk pool due to more favorable premium rates afforded to them in the pre-ACA rating formula.  The remaining population expected to enroll in the ACA qualifying products represents a small portion of the pool, and those groups generally have unfavorable demographics and higher than average costs.Historical Financial Experience:The historical experience is for Highmark&rsquo;s subsidiary HHIC.  Highmark Inc. did not have any small group plans available in 2013 and HHIC&rsquo;s experience has been used to price these plans.  This experience is listed below.Three-year financial experience for the HHIC Small Group segment is as follows:2013 Premium $892,423,0002013 Claims $802,561,0002013 Operating Results ($22,664,000)2013 Loss Ratio 89.9%2012 Premium $1,003,072,0002012 Claims $899,818,0002012 Operating Results ($15,687,000)2012 Loss Ratio 89.7%2011 Premium $1,086,460,0002011 Claims $933,662,0002011 Operating Results $34,798,0002011 Loss Ratio 85.9%Change in Medical Service Costs:While the 2013 experience for the non-grandfathered plans rose at a moderate 4.5%, the projected population is expected to add another 20.6% to the cost of medical care per member per month (PMPM).  This is relative to the assumptions used in the 2014 rate filing, which was submitted before the transitional policies were announced and assumed that all small groups would migrate to the ACA pool in 2014.  This is offset slightly by higher allowed demographic factors.Change in Benefits:No benefit changes are being proposed within this filing.Administrative Costs and Anticipated Operating Results:Relative to the 2014 rate filing, internal administrative costs remain essentially flat on a per member per month basis.  The Health Insurer Tax increases in 2015 by another 1.5% of premium.  The total administrative costs are lower, as a percent of premium, due to the higher projected claim costs.The anticipated operating results are not excessive or unreasonable.

Scope and Range of the Rate IncreaseCF is proposing to raise premiums by 15.0% on average, prior to age band changes.  The range is 5.4% to 21.0%. For renewing customers, an age band change adds 2.6% to the renewal, on average, with a range of 0.0% to 4.7% for ages 22 and upwards per the CMS age curve.2. Financial Experience of the ProductThe products in this filing were first launched on 1-1-14, and therefore have no experience in the 2013 experience period.  The closed non-grandfathered products from 2013, upon which these rates were based, had total premiums and allowed claims for the incurred period of 1-1-13 through 12-31-13 of $6,355,681 and $7,029,573.The primary factors driving this proposed change in premium rates are:a) Projected significant increase in membership volumes with average morbidities higher than 2014.  CareFirst estimates a morbidity risk factor of 1.35 for 2015.    The morbidity risk factor projections are based upon the model that supported CareFirst&rsquo;s 2014 rate filings.  The model compares known and estimated allowed claims costs per member per month (PMPM) for 2013 to project the costs of various categories of the estimated 2015 membership.b) An aging of the pool of members.  The age of HMO members changed dramatically by increasing 9.3 years, from 27.9 to 37.2.c) An increase in the cost of medical care delivery in the form of claims trend driven by increases in both unit cost and utilization.  See description in section 3.d) An increase in the Health Insurer Fee.  See description in section 4.Our projected DICR for MLR purposes is 83.7%, meeting the 80.0% minimum of Public Health Service Act (PHSA) 218.3. Changes in Medical Service CostsThe proposed trend of 9.0% is a reduction of 200 basis points from 2014&rsquo;s 11.0%.4. Changes in BenefitsAdjustments have been made for pediatric dental, mandatory generics, a new Hepatitis C prescription drug called Sovaldi and maternity.CF is proposing to introduce an incentive program (IP) whereby members can earn medical expense debit cards of as much as $250 annually, for an individual ($650 for a family). The cards must be utilized for qualified medical expenses such as deductibles, copays and out-of-pocket costs. The scope includes all benefit plans within CF&rsquo;s portfolio, On and Off the Exchange. This is being done in a revenue-neutral way.Retail Clinics such as urgent care centers will have reduced copays to match the PCP rather than specialist copay with a negligible price impact.For the Young Adult-Catastrophic plan, the deductible-out-of-pocket maximum has been raised from $6,350 to $6,600.A 5-tiered structure (Generics-Preferred, Generics-Non-Preferred, Brand Name-Preferred, Brand Name-Non-Preferred, Specialty) is currently used for approximately 20% of our benefits. This is changing to a 4-tier structure by collapsing the Generics tiers.Included in this calculation are decreases to claims costs for 1) a change in our Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) in 2014 and 2) a reduction in our fee schedule for out-of-network (OON) utilization for HMO-based products that have an OON option (a.k.a., NP3).5.

This increase is anticipated to impact approximately 67,000 members. It&rsquo;s important to note that a subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate increase could be higher or lower depending on the benefit plan selected, geographic location, dependent coverage and other factors It should also be noted that we are projecting that our medical loss ratio, as defined by the ACA, for all individual products under the Empire HealthChoice HMO, Inc legal entity will meet the minimum MLR requirement.Financial ExperienceFor 2013 Empire reported a 91.0% ACA-defined medical loss ratio (MLR) for all Individual plans, which exceeded the federal MLR requirement of 82%. Empire was not required to issue rebates as more than 82.0% of the premium dollar was spent on medical care and quality improvement programs, as required by the ACA. In total, Empire expects the rates in the small group pool will yield an ACA-defined medical loss ratio of 88.9% in 2015, significantly above the federal MLR requirement of 82.0%.Changes in Medical CostsThe primary driver of the premium increase is the continued increase in the cost of healthcare. The increases are associated with increases in the&ldquo;unit&rdquo; cost of services primarily from hospitals, physicians and pharmaceutical companies, coupled with increases in the consumption of services, or&ldquo;utilization&rdquo;, by members. Increases in the unit costs of services are driven by many things, including technology advances, cost shifting to private insurers from inadequate Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement, general inflationary pressures, and a variety of other factors. The recent approval and release of a new Hepatitis C drug, which currently costs $1,000 per pill and $84,000 to complete the 84 pill regimen, is an example of these increased cost pressures. Additionally, changes in the utilization of services can be driven by benefit design, economic conditions, and many other factors. Within the projected medical trends, Empire anticipates small increases from higher utilization, while the majority of the increases are associated with higher unit costs. Empire believes its projected medical trends are reasonable, and fall within the range of industry norms.What is Empire doing to keep premiums affordable?Empire is investing in many initiatives to reduce the cost of care, promote wellness and preventive care for our members and communities, as well as working with providers to encourage high-quality, evidence-based care, which costs less over time.We are focusing on patient-centered primary care to ensure coordination of care among all settings, rewarding hospitals and physicians for quality and outcomes such as reducing or eliminating avoidable readmissions, and providing the data that our providers need to assist them in managing a patient&rsquo;s overall condition.We are dedicated to working with our members to find health coverage plans that are the most appropriate, beneficial and affordable for their needs. Also, to help our members manage costs, we continue to negotiate the best possible rates for covered products and provider services, and we are making more tools available to help members better manage health and out-of-pocket costs.As a New York based company that has done business here for over 75 years, we care about our customers and the community. We share the concerns raised by our members over the rising costs of health care services and the corresponding impact they have on premiums, particularly in this challenging economy. At Empire, we are committed to driving quality in the health care system, improving the lives of not only the members we serve, but also the health of communities across New York.",Review Complete,7.37,80519NY016,HMO,"Empire HealthChoice HMO, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Annual,18.17,18.17,RC

573234,20895,Individual,ST,01/01/2015,false,07/22/2014,10/29/2014,Not Unreasonable,"Humana utilized its 2013 individual market experience for the experience period and adjusted for expected changes in population morbidity and demographics as well as benefit changes. The credibility assigned to the experience was 22.8% based on 18,446 member months. Humana&rsquo;s credibility threshold is 356,000 member months, which was derived based on a 95% confidence interval that actual claims would be within 5% of expected. Though there are no well-defined credibility standards for commercial, ACA-health insurance, this threshold is higher than is typically used.  Humana anticipated significant changes in the makeup of the projected block of business compared to that underlying the 2013 experience due to the market changes and employer decisions for purchasing healthcare.Humana includes a profit and risk margin of 2.8% in its 2015 rates. The federal MLR estimate is 80.0%, which does not include any credibility adjustment. It is assumed that without the credibility adjustment, this is a conservative estimate, and the actual MLR, for purposes of determining any rebates due to consumers, will be higher.Change in Expected Morbidity (-20.4%): Although Humana is assuming that morbidity of the population insured will be worse than the base period risk pool due to relative risk of the uninsured population, adverse selection, and migration from small group, the assumed morbidity is lower than that assumed for 2014 rates. The adjustment for 2015 projections reflects a 44.3% adjustment compared to 64.3% assumed in 2014 rating.Change in Experience (-2.4%): The normalized experience for 2013, used for 2015 rating, was better than expected compared to the 2012 experience, used for 2014 rating.Trend (+10.5%): The assumed annual trend used for the 2015 rating is 9.3%, an increase from the 7.5% assumed for 2014 rating. The increase is due to changes observed in the experience period and anticipated higher costs for new drugs.Changes in Benefits (+2.1%): Humana refined estimated pricing for new EHB benefits, including preventive benefits added to EHBs starting in 2015, and Nevada&rsquo;s recent legislation to limit member cost sharing on orally administered chemotherapy medications. Humana also updated and made a correction to the estimated impact of induced utilization for plans with lower cost sharing.Age and Gender (+3.7%): Age and gender assumptions were refined based on actual enrollment seen in 2014. This revealed a higher number of older adults and females than originally projected.ACA Taxes and Fees (+0.6%): Humana adjusted the target loss ratio to reflect the increased federal income tax liability for the non-deductible Health Insurer Fees.Risk Adjustment (+17.0%): The 2014 pricing reflected an expected volume of new sales that would impact the morbidity as the new entrants were expected to have higher risk scores. Based on the 2014 membership, Humana&rsquo;s expected mix of underwritten and non-underwritten membership for 2015 is expected to produce a lower morbidity relative to the market average compared to that assumed in the 2014 rates.Paid to Allowed Ratio (+3.2%): According to Humana, the paid to allowed ratio varies by metal tier due to different utilization patterns for each metal tier. The 2015 paid to allowed ratio reflects an updated expectation of the mix of enrollment by metal tier. The +3.2% rate impact also includes leveraging of fixed copays and deductibles.The reviews by Wakely Consulting and Nevada Division of Insurance focused on compliance with Chapters 689A and 686B of the Nevada Revised Statutes and the Health and Human Services Final Rate Review Regulation Part 154 Health Insurance Rate Increases: Disclosure and Review Requirements.Based on the reviews of the relevant items listed in Section 154.301 of the HHS Final Rate Review Regulation, it has been determined that a 10.11 percent rate increase is not unreasonable.",Not Applicable,"The requested average rate increase for the HumanaOne 2014 PPO products 20895NV044 in this filing, effective January 1, 2015, is 10.1 percent when compared to current rates i.e. rates effective January 1, 2014.This filing includes rates for both ACA compliant plans offered outside the exchange and nongrandfathered plans issued prior to 2014 that have been made ACA compliant.Many factors influence this rate calculation.

The combination of guaranteed access to coverage, the extension of non ACA compliant plans under transitional relief rules and a state with a comparatively small number of individual consumers may not be sustainable as currently structured.  Although the ACA includes some risk mitigation programs (reinsurance, risk adjustment and risk corridors) these are insufficient in a state that lacks an individual market which is large or stable enough to spread risk.The risk experience in the metallic plan risk pool is further influenced by the fact that 50 percent of the state&rsquo;s high risk pool (ACHIA) and 100 percent of the federal Preexisting Condition Insurance Pool have left those plans and have likely now purchased coverage in the individual market.  Premera may have obtained a disproportionate share of these individuals.Premera is committed to working with the Division of Insurance (DOI), the State, and the industry to develop and implement programs that will help to stabilize the market and keep costs affordable for individual consumers.   As a result, our 2015 rate filing is significantly lower than is needed to break even for our metallic lines of business.

However, most likely as a result of problems with Healthcare.gov and the extension of nonmetallic plans under transitional relief, only 6,000 consumers enrolled.The demographic composition of those that did enroll in metallic plans was older and less healthy than anticipated.Just to break even, given the claims experience we are currently seeing, would require a 72.3 percent rate increase for our individual metallic plans for 2015.

Based on data through April 2014, Premera currently projects a $3.6 million loss serving individual market customers on metallic plans in 2014 without commercial reinsurance.Our estimates show that without a rate increase for 2015, these losses could increase to $37 million in 2015, based on a market of 12,000 members.

In addition to medical claims, the following costs will also be incurred:ACA related taxes and fees, including fees paid toward Healthcare.gov, account for 6.9percent of the rate dollar in 2015.Premera continues to focus on increasing efficiency and reducing our administrative expenses. These costs are expected to account for 6percent of the rate dollar in 2015.Commission to producers brokers is expected to account for 3percent of members&rsquo; premium dollar in 2015Financial experience of the product:2014 is the first year of experience for these products. Based on data through April 2014, Premera currently projects a $3.6 million loss serving individual market customers on metallic plans in 2014 without commercial reinsurance.Our estimates show that without a rate increase for 2015, these losses could increase to $37 million in 2015, based on a market of 12,000 members.

Under Maryland law, rates may not be inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.  Each rate filing is reviewed on its own merits.  The Commissioner&rsquo;s rate decisions must be based on statistical analysis and reasonable assumptions.  To assist the Commissioner in making these decisions, Maryland Insurance Administration (&ldquo;MIA&rdquo;) actuaries examine the data, methods and assumptions used by each insurer, non-profit health service plan, or HMO (&ldquo;carrier&rdquo;).  They review numerous factors related to proposed premium rates, including the carrier&rsquo;s actual and projected claims experience, medical and prescription costs, administrative costs, and profits or losses.  The Commissioner also considers the impact premium rates will have on Maryland consumers.  Under the federal Affordable Care Act and Maryland law, in the individual and small group markets, 80 cents of every premium dollar must be spent on paying claims or on quality improvement activities that figure increases to 85 cents in the large group market.  If an insurance carrier does not meet these targets, the carrier must pay rebates to policyholders.Modifications to Requested Premium Rates and Basis of ModificationsCareFirst BlueChoice submitted a rate filing on May 1, 2014, requesting an average rate increase of 33.5%.  On May 23, 2014, the Company amended its filing to request an average rate increase of 22.8%.  The amended rate filing reflected certain minor adjustments in response to MIA objections, such as modifying its assumptions about projected average age and the projected cost and utilization of dental benefits.  The most significant change, however, was a reduction in the Company&rsquo;s projections about the morbidity of its 2015 individual market enrollees as compared with the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  Specifically, in its amended filing, the Company assigned to its projected 2015 individual market enrollees a morbidity factor that was 1.60 times the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  In its May 1, 2014 filing, the Company had assumed a morbidity factor of 1.75.  The MIA proceeded to review the amended May 23, 2014 filing.The MIA concluded that certain of the Company&rsquo;s data, methods, and assumptions were not well supported, including certain assumptions about the projected morbidity of its individual product enrollees in 2015.  In particular, the Company had not adequately supported its assumptions regarding the number of small group enrollees projected to migrate to its individual products, or its assumptions about the morbidity levels of previously uninsured enrollees.  The MIA further concluded that the Company&rsquo;s actual experience during the first half of 2014, as well as other considerations relating to actual and projected enrollment in the 2014 and 2015 individual market, did not support a 1.60 morbidity factor.  The Commissioner also concluded that the requested average premium rate increase of 22.8% would have an abrupt, substantial, and adverse impact on the approximately 74,708 Marylanders currently enrolled in CareFirst BlueChoice Affordable Care Act-compliant plans in the individual market, and would introduce a high level of volatility into Maryland&rsquo;s individual health insurance market.The MIA prescribed a morbidity factor of 1.40, rather than the Company&rsquo;s requested morbidity factor of 1.60.  This modification resulted in an approximately 10.6% reduction in the Company&rsquo;s proposed premium rates for 2015.As modified during the rate review process, CareFirst BlueChoice&rsquo;s premium rates for 2015 reflect an approximately 9.8% increase as compared with its premium rates for 2014.Final DeterminationPursuant to&sect; 11-603(c)(2) of the Insurance Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, the Commissioner has determined that the Company&rsquo;s premium rates, as modified during the rate review process, are not inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.",Not Applicable,"CAREFIRST BLUECROSS BLUESHIELD (CF)RATE REVIEW REPORTINGPART II&ndash; WRITTEN EXPLANATION OF RATE INCREASECareFirst submits this rate filing as directed by MIA Order No. 2014-08-008 (the MIA Order).  The rates set forth in this filing were calculated as directed in the MIA Order, and CareFirst believes that they are inadequate.Accordingly, while the rates in this submission are filed as directed by the MIA Order and based upon the prescribed morbidity factor of 1.40, the information contained in this Actuarial Memorandum reflects a morbidity factor of 1.60.1.	SCOPE AND RANGE OF THE RATE INCREASE: CF is proposing to raise annual premiums by 9.8%, prior to age band changes. (For CFI the proposed renewal is 11.9%.) The range is 5.2% to 13.7%. (For renewing customers, an age band change adds 2.6% to the renewal, on average, with a range of 0.0% to 4.7% for ages 22 and upwards per the CMS age curve.)The primary factors driving this proposed change in premium rates are:a)	Projected significant increase in membership volumes with average morbidities higher than 2014.b)	Migration in the pool of former enrollees in Maryland&rsquo;s high risk pool the Maryland Health Insurance Plan (MHIP).c)	An aging of the pool of members.d)	An increase in the cost of medical care delivery in the form of claims trend driven by increases in both unit cost and utilization.e)	An increase in the health insurer fee.2.	FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE OF THE PRODUCT: The incurred period is 1-1-13 through 12-31-13. Total premiums and allowed claims for the period were $41,069,923 and $50,589,223, respectively.A.	Changes in the Morbidity of the Population Insured: CareFirst calculated its proposed rates based upon a morbidity factor of 1.60 however, the rates in this filing are calculated based upon a morbidity factor of 1.40 as ordered by the MIA Order.CareFirst estimates a morbidity risk factor of 1.60 for 2015 as relayed through the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filings (SERFF) on 5-23-14. Our 1.60 factor was computed after consideration for the morbidity risk factor that was included in the 2014 filed and approved rates.  The morbidity risk factor projections are based upon the model that supported CareFirst&rsquo;s 2014 rate filings.  The model compares known and estimated allowed claims costs per member per month (pmpm) for 2013 to project the cost of various categories of the estimated 2015 membership.These categories are based upon the prior status of the 2015 membership - previous CareFirst members (medically underwritten under 65 Individuals, MHIP, Group) and New Entrants sorted by income (less than 200% FPL, greater than 200% FPL).  The risk factor for each category is expressed in terms of allowed claims pmpm cost, and is calculated by comparing the category pmpm claims cost to the 2013 CareFirst Individual membership pmpm cost.  More than 50% of the projected 2015 membership is included in categories supported by actual claims data supporting the previous CareFirst member categories.  The New Entrants&rsquo; categories use projected risk scores based upon a Hilltop study (Basic Health Plan) for the members less than 200% FPL and the Group factor for the greater than 200% FPL members. The Group factor is based upon the almost 250 thousand CareFirst Small Group members that have for decades been community rated and guaranteed issue as is now required under ACA for Individual enrollees. CareFirst&rsquo;s judgment is that this extremely large community rated, guaranteed issue small group pool of members is most representative of the New Entrants greater than 200% FPL.B.	Changes in Demographics: Comparing the overall CareFirst member-level average age as of 12-31-12 to 3-31-14, the average age has increased by 4.5 years from 34.0 to 38.5. Age factors will account for a portion of the corresponding increase in claims cost. We find the CMS age curve spread of 3 to 1 to be lower than the 4.5 to 1 that is more correlated with expected claims costs. We have therefore adjusted expected claims costs accordingly in the experience period (EP) index rate projection in the other category.C.	Trend Factors (Cost-Utilization): The proposed trend of 8.0% is a reduction of 120 basis points from 2014&rsquo;s 9.2%.D.	Projected Loss Ratio: Our projected NAIC DICR for MLR purposes is 82.3%, above the 80.0% minimum of Public Health Service Act (PHSA) 218.3.	CHANGES IN MEDICAL SERVICE COSTS: The experience period index rate is a key component driving the renewal. Last year&rsquo;s implicit 2013 index rate was $230 ($211 x trend of 9.2%). The actual for 2013 is $223 for a favorable variance of -3%.4.	CHANGES IN BENEFITS: For CareFirst&rsquo;s Individual offerings in Maryland, our portfolio is not changing. We will still offer 15 benefit plans&ndash; 1 Young Adult-Catastrophic, 4 Bronze, 4 Silver, 4 Gold and 2 Platinum. We have recalculated the costs of Essential Health Benefits (EHB) as well as Non-EHBs.a)	Per COMAR 31.10.39 Utilization Review of Treatment for Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders, Bulletin 14-07 and due to the passage of SB 759-HB 783, Coverage for Autism Spectrum Disorders, we have calculated an increase in claims of $3 per member per month (PMPM) for 2015. This is largely for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) treatments and is a state-mandated EHB benefit. The $3 PMPM is derived from an incidence assumption of 1 in 68 children ages 1-19, an uptake rate of 1 in 3 and an intensity rate of $40,000 to $95,000 per year depending on age.b)	Other adjustments were made for pediatric dental, mandatory generics, a new hepatitis C prescription drug, Sovaldi, and maternity.c)	Other Adjustments: CareFirst (CF) is proposing to introduce an incentive program (IP) whereby members can earn medical expense debit cards of as much as $250 annually, for an individual ($650 for a family). The cards must be utilized for qualified medical expenses such as deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket costs. The scope includes all benefit plans within CF&rsquo;s portfolio, On and Off the Exchange. This is being done in a revenue-neutral way. That is, the cost to CF of the incentive payments was chosen such that they match the expected savings to CF from more efficacious health care delivery. HealthyBlue (HB) was first launched effective 10-1-10 with the objective of motivating and rewarding greater engagement by the member in his or her health, improved wellness and prevention and better provider coordination and quality. As we sought to respond to feedback about HB, subsequent versions were released on 1-1-12 and 10-1-12. This IP represents an evolution of the HB concept. Further, it joins the tenets of HB with our Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) program which was launched on January, 2011.Our aim is that this IP will improve our members&rsquo; health.d)	Included are decreases to claims costs for 1) a change in our Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) in 2014 and 2) a reduction in our fee schedule for out-of-network (OON) utilization for HMO-based products that have an OON option (a.k.a., NP3).e)	Membership Projections: We had projected 58% of enrollment in HMO-based plans as of 12-31-14 in our 2014 filings. Actual data as of 4-10-14 indicates that HMO comprises 69% of our CFI members. We had also expected 5% of enrollment in Platinum plans versus actuals of 13%. We incorporated both of these facts in projecting 12-31-15 enrollment.f)	    For the Young Adult-Catastrophic plan, the deductible-out-of-pocket maximum has been raised from $6,350 to $6,600 per year.g)	Also, per HB 0625, oral chemotherapy coverage has been mandated. The cost of reducing cost shares to not exceed those of intravenous chemotherapy has been deemed negligible.h)	Diabetic supplies have been moved to $0 copays. The deductible applies for H.S.A. plans but not for non-H.S.A.s with negligible price impact.i)	    Retail Clinics such as urgent care centers will have reduced copays to match the PCP rather than specialist copay with negligible price impact.j)	    A 5-tiered structure (Generics-Preferred, Generics-Non-Preferred, Brand Name-Preferred, Brand Name-Non-Preferred, Specialty) is currently used for approximately 20% of our benefits. This is changing to 4-tier structure by collapsing the Generics tiers.5.	ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED CONTRIBUTION TO RESERVE: The 2015 desired incurred claims ratio (DICR) is 76.8%.A.	Administrative Expense Load: PMPMs increased by 3% versus 2014.B.	CtR&amp; Risk Margin: Remains at 0.0%, break-even.C.	Taxes and Fees:I.	State Premium Tax of 2.0%.II.

We have a deep understanding of the affordability crisis within the healthcare marketplace and understand the challenge individuals and families have in paying premiums for their coverage. We understand that as a medical insurer we have a role in controlling costs. During the last several years we have reduced our administration and commission expenses significantly. Fundamentally, the vast majority of our rate increases reflect the cost of medical care that we fund on behalf of our policyholders. The following response helps to inform customers and other stakeholders about the company&rsquo;s position.1) How Assurant Health sets rates:Assurant Health is committed to setting premium rates at a level that allows us to continue to serve the needs of our customers. Our premium rates are based on appropriate actuarial practices, backed by decades of experience and expertise in the individual market.  In addition, we worked with independent actuarial consultants to validate our pricing methodology.  We maintain our recent rate filings are actuarially justified and appropriate, and that they will enable Assurant Health to meet the medical loss ratio (MLR) requirements under health care reform.2) Assumption support:We provided substantial support for the assumptions on which the 2015 rate increase is based.Plans effective on or after January 1, 2014 are guaranteed issue, which means all applicants must be issued coverage regardless of health status, this continues to impact the morbidity of the single risk pool in 2015.  We provided detailed support, including consultant data, outlining the development of our morbidity assumption, which adjusts for the impact of the guaranteed issue environment.Our medical trend assumption is supported by historical data and is based on the historical average claims trend of our customers. Assurant Health uses medical trend data that factors in both the rising cost of health care and the utilization of medical services and prescription drugs by our customers in determining premium rates.","This is a Time Insurance Company rate filing for our existing individual medical products.These are non-grandfathered Individual Major Medical products which cover the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) as required under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The development of the rates for these plans is detailed in the Part III Actuarial Memorandum.2014 premium and claims experience for these products is not yet complete.The requested average rate increase is 23%.  The range of rate increase is 10% - 43%, not including attained age.  There are 3,745 covered individuals who will be impacted by this rate increase in Missouri.  The rate increase will be effective January 1, 2015.The rate increase was developed based on the pricing methodology prescribed by the ACA.This rate increase is needed because allowed medical trend is assumed to continue at an annual rate of 9.5%.  This includes increases in both the price and utilization of medical services.  In addition, there are new fees associated with the ACA which contributed to the rate increase. The increase is also caused by a decrease in reinsurance recoveries provided by the ACA reinsurance program. The guarantee issue environment also results in increased costs as there continues to be migration from other market segments.The loss ratio is the ratio of incurred claims to earned premium.  In Missouri, the target loss ratio is 74.5%, which equates to the 80% Medical Loss Ratio under the ACA after allowable adjustments.The main drivers of our administrative expenses are employee salaries and benefits, agent commissions, and premium taxes, licenses and fees.

This rate increase explanation should help FHCP consumers identify and explain the key drivers of the rate increase in PPACA compliant Individual plans. The overall average rate increase reflected in the filing is 11.1 percent.  The rate increase will vary slightly due to the consumers&rsquo; age, selected plan, and any federal subsidies.  This rate increase will take effect January 1, 2015 and rates will remain in effect until December 31, 2015.Reason for Rate Increase. This rate increase is proposed for all FHCP PPACA compliant plans.  The proposed rate increase is due to the following reasons.Market Risk-The experience of the FHCP Individual PPACA plans is more adverse than assumed in the current 2014 rates.  For example, the Transitional Policy that was announced by the Administration, first articulated in November 2013, and subsequently extended in March 2014, is projected to result in a more adverse population than assumed in the current rates because previously medically underwritten non-grandfathered members are allowed to remain in transitional plans.Medical Inflation, Trend, Combined effect of medical provider price increases, utilization changes, medical cost shifting, and new medical procedures and technology.Reinsurance Credit-Reduction in reinsurance coinsurance from 2014 to 2015.Addition of coverage for Essential Health Benefits i.e. Breast Pump expanded coverage, Oral Chemo Parity.An adjustment for additional prescription drugs that were added to the formulary, i.e. Solvadi and Olysio.Increase in Insurer Fee, PCORI, Exchange Fee, as a result of assumed increase in the proportion of on exchange revenue based on 2014 experience.Financial experience of the product. FHCP has only sold PPACA compliant plans in 2014.  FHCP does not have credible financial experience for these PPACA compliant plans.Changes in Medical Service Costs. FHCP medical costs have been increasing moderately.  This is in part due to the fact that FHCP is a hybrid of Staff Physicians and contracted FFS Physicians.  Also, FHCP owns and operates our own Pharmacies. Thus, low trend factors were used to project future PPACA plan medical costs.Changes in benefits.  FHCP has 33 Individual Product IDs.  All products have the option of the Gym benefit. FHCP has an HMO and a POS Network.  Plan benefits are generally deductible and coinsurance, with some plans having copays on professional services.  Pediatric Dental will no longer be included as an optional benefit.  There were some additional Essential Health Benefits that were required in 2015 i.e. Breast Pump expanded coverage, Oral Chemo Coverage, Over-the-Counter Coverage.Administrative costs and anticipated profits. Administrative costs for FHCP&rsquo;s Individual PPACA plans have been moderately higher than expected in 2014.  There are the required Administrative Taxes and Fees, in additional to the increasing PPACA fees.  FHCP profits are projected to be similar to our current Commercial lines of business.  No additional adjustment was made for higher risk.",Review Complete,11.28,56503FL187,IND Platinum PREMIER TROP Essential Plus  28,"Florida Health Care Plan, Inc.",FLORIDA,FL,Annual,11.28,11.28,RC

(Bolton Health) to provide independent actuarial reviews of health insurance rate filings submitted to DORA.This disposition letter is prepared for the purpose of documenting the primary pricing components of Humana Insurance Company&rsquo;s (Humana) rate filing numbered Sircon 288398, other uses may be inappropriate.IntroductionThe purpose of Humana&rsquo;s filing (Sircon 288398) is to offer a small group major medical product, covering essential health benefits, into the Colorado market. The plans submitted under this filing are intended to only be sold off of Connect for Health Colorado (the Colorado health exchange).The proposed overall annual rate increase from 1/1/2014 to 1/1/2015 associated with this filing is 12.32% and will range from 12.13% to 12.52% throughout 2015.PlansHumana filed multiple Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) and indemnity plan designs under Sircon 288398.  Table 1 (below) summarizes each of these plan designs.Projected Premiums and Claims ExpenseHumana Insurance Company&rsquo;s calendar year 2013 small group claims data only included claims for approximately 248 lives as of December 31, 2013.  Based on the Colorado credibility requirement stipulated in Colorado regulation 4-2-39, Humana assigned 35% credibility to this experience. In order to achieve a 100% credibility level, Humana combined this data with the Humana Health Plan Inc. small group experience for 2013 which contained approximately 12,000 lives.  This experience is fully credible and meets all Colorado credibility requirements.For the purpose of projecting to 2015, Humana applied the following adjustments to the 2013 allowed claims shown in Table 2, unless specified otherwise, all factors listed below are multiplicative:&bull;	Trend&ndash; Humana applied two years of trend using a factor of 1.122, which translates to an annual allowed trend of 5.83%.  This trend factor was developed based on historical area specific trends from Humana&rsquo;s Small Group Commercial block of business data.&bull;	Morbidity&ndash; Humana applied a 0.813 adjustment factor intended to capture the change in underlying morbidity for the risk pool in 2015 compared to the experience period. Reasons for this change include groups moving to individual coverage, the risk of projected new sales, and the impact from groups moving to an early renewal date.&bull;	Changes in Benefits&ndash; A 1.037 adjustment factor was applied to account for the addition of benefits that must be covered under the EHB package.  These benefits include pediatric dental, pediatric vision, FHM parity, private duty nursing, women&rsquo;s preventive services, orthodontia, chiropractic, prosthetics, lung cancer screenings, and breast cancer drugs.  This adjustment factor also includes anticipated changes in the average utilization of services due to differences in average cost sharing requirements during the experience period and in the projection period.&bull;	Risk Adjustment&ndash; Humana used an adjustment factor to account for the expected transfer amount due to the risk adjustment process. This adjustment factor was derived from Humana&rsquo;s participation in a study by Wakely Consulting.  The projected risk adjustment is $13.64 PMPM and includes the Risk Adjuster Fee which will be charged at $0.96 PMPY or $0.08 PMPM.&bull;	Reinsurance&ndash; The Reinsurance Assessment Fee will be charge at $44 PMPY or $3.67 PMPM in compliance with the Federal Register&ndash; Vol. 78, No. 231.&bull;	Changes in Demographics&ndash; Humana applied a 1.010 adjustment factor intended to capture the change in age and gender from the experience period to the projection period.  This adjustment is based on historical nationwide age/gender rating factors to calculate the average change in claims.&bull;	Pooling Charge&ndash; Humana applied a 1.054 pooling charge factor.RetentionHumana loaded its rates for a target loss ratio of 80.0%.  The following table (Table 3) summarizes the non-benefit expenses used in the development of Humana&rsquo;s 2015 premiums, values shown in Table 3 are expressed as a percent of premium.Table 3&ndash; Retention ComponentsAdmin Category	                                Percent of PremiumAdministrative Expenses	                        8.50%Commissions	                                        5.40%Premium Taxes	                                0.30%Profit&amp; Contingency Margin	                3.30%Investment Income	                                0.00%Retention to Cover PPACA fees	        2.50%Total Retention	                                20.00%Pricing Loss Ratio (1 - Total Retention)	80.00%As can be seen in Table 3, the retention load includes a marginal 3.30% for profit&amp; contingencies. Furthermore, after removing the retention required to cover ACA fees the target benefit ratio becomes 82.50%, (1.0&ndash; (0.2000&ndash; 0.0250)). Finally, note that Humana&rsquo;s filing includes a demonstration of the Federal Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).This demonstration estimates a federal MLR of 86.30%, which exceeds the federal minimum of 80%.Rating VariablesFinally, consumer monthly premiums are adjusted for age, region, and Actuarial Value Pricing Factors (or plan factors).&bull;	Age&ndash; the Humana age factors comply with the 3:1 maximum variance for ages 21 and above.&bull;	Tobacco Use&ndash; Humana does not rate separately for tobacco use during the effective period.&bull;	Region&ndash; Humana developed regional rating factors based on the nine rating areas set forth by DORA. The regional factors are the same regardless of plan type.&bull;	Plan Factors&ndash; The 2014 plan factors were developed using an internal pricing model with underlying utilization and costs reflective of a standard population equal to that of the anticipated membership in the overall projected risk pool.Public CommentsNo public comments were submitted to the Commissioner related to this filing.ConclusionWe reviewed Humana&rsquo;s filing for compliance with applicable actuarial standards of practice (ASOPs) and state and federal regulations.

However, periodic rate adjustments are necessary to secure the ability of COORDINATED HEALTH MUTUAL, INC. to cover medical claims costs and recent changes to required benefits.Will premiums increase the same amount for all Individuals?No, while the average increase throughout Ohio will be 14.35 percent, the actual realized increase for an individual will be dependent upon the plan they choose and their location.Why do we need to increase premiums?There are numerous factors contributing to our need for the rate increase. The main drivers include medical cost trends, 7.3 percent, benefit changes, 1.0 percent, change in transitional reinsurance parameters, 4.2 percent, change in administrative costs, 3.5 percent, change in taxes and fees, 2.2 percent, and change in profit, 1 percent.

COORDINATED HEALTH MUTUAL, INC. was formed out of the Affordable Care Act as a nonprofit, mutual CO-OP or Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan and was licensed as an insurance carrier in Ohio in September 2013. As a result of our smaller membership, overall administrative expenses and unforeseen expense increases for reporting have a disproportionally large impact on the premium rates. We are also incurring a fee to be on the exchange in 2015. Going beyond 2015 this fee will already be accounted for in the rates so it will not impact future rate changes. Finally, the changes to the Transitional Federal Reinsurance program have resulted in an increase of 4.2 percent to the premium rates.

Also, we are making more tools and plans available to help members better manage their health and out of pocket costs. Some of these enhancements include Medical Management Programs for those diagnosed with Diabetes and Asthma or for expectant mothers. Individual members who participate in these programs will receive their related medications, supplies, one-on-one support and self-management materials for free. We are also creating a Depression Management program which would include the first generic prescription at no cost to participants, one-on-one support, self-management materials and an innovative on-line tool to boost self-management and coordination between the member&rsquo;s various providers and care-givers.

The anticipated entry of nearly 100% of over 26,000 MCHA members into the individual market is putting upward cost pressure on 2015 rates. Initially, the phase out of Minnesota's long-standing high risk pool was planned to occur over a three year period. However, high risk pool members have voluntarily migrated over to the individual market much faster than expected in 2014 already, likely owing to the very favorable rate decreases MCHA members experience. MCHA is expected to be closed in early 2015. Minnesota is an outlier in the more significant upward rate pressure for 2015 coming from the high risk pool migration.Also, Minnesota is the only state operating a Basic Health Plan. The Basic Health Plan covers many of the previously uninsured and does not participate in the individual market's statewide risk pool. The Basic Health Plan (MinnesotaCare) mitigates the enrollment growth of the Minnesota individual market relatively, as compared to other states, though has contributed to the significant reduction in the uninsured rate. As an example of how Minnesota is different from other states, there are 0 (zero) enrollees in the 87% or 94% federal plan design cost sharing reduction subsidy in Minnesota on the individual market, as those people participate instead in MinnesotaCare.",Not Applicable,"This rate change will impact both members enrolled in new benefit plans in 2014 and members on guaranteed renewable individual benefit plans offered prior to January 1, 2014.  The average increase, based on the calculation embedded in the federal rate filing worksheet, is 10.3 percent.Members enrolled on new silver and bronze plans will receive rate increases of 9.5 to 12.9 percent.  Members enrolled on catastrophic plans will receive rate changes of -10.4 to -7.7 percent.Members enrolled on plans offered prior to January 1, 2014 will receive rate increases of 9.5 to 15.4 percent.Factors contributing to the rate increaseThe most significant factors contributing to the rate increase are as followsExpected changes in overall individual market membership. Rates reflect the overall membership in Minnesota&rsquo;s individual market as there will be a risk adjustment mechanism moving premium from health plans with lower risk, or lower cost, members to health plans with higher risk members, with higher expected costs.  Three significant changes expected in 2015 are as follows1.	Minnesota Comprehensive Health Association, known as MCHA, members. Members unable to obtain coverage in the individual market prior to 2014 due to health conditions were able to purchase coverage in MCHA, Minnesota&rsquo;s high risk pool.   Although most states discontinued their high risk pool at the end of 2013 sending members into the individual market in 2014, MCHA continued through 2014.  In calculating our 2014 rates, we assumed a small percentage of MCHA membership would enter the 2014 individual market. In calculating our 2015 rates, we are assuming most MCHA membership will be part of the 2015 individual market.  As these members have very high medical costs, this increases the individual market rates.  MCHA is funded through an assessment on all insured premiums.  We expect there to be no MCHA assessment in 2015, this offsets a small part of the increased costs.2.	Employer Group Members.  We are seeing members from Small and Large Employer groups moving into the individual market.  As the individual rates and medical costs are lower than those of most employer groups, this increases the individual market rates.3.	Uninsured.  We are expecting more of the uninsured people to enter the individual market in 2015.  These new members are expected to be lower cost than average individual market members and thus decrease the rate need in the individual market.Increases in medical costs are driven by the following1.	We expect medical costs to increase by 4 percent from 2014 to 2015.  This will cause a 5.4 percent increase in health plan covered medical costs as the portion of total costs covered by member cost-sharing declines.  This medical trend includes increases in number of services provided, increases in prices by medical providers and pharmaceutical companies, and the cost of new medical treatments and drugs.2.	Solvaldi, the new drug for Hepatitis C, is separately added to projected medical claims due to the high cost of this drug, averaging $84,000 per patient.Benefit Changes are as follows1.	There were slight decreases to member cost-sharing on 4 benefit plans offered prior to January 1, 2014.  These cost-sharing changes were required by a change in regulatory instructions and cause a slight rate increase on these benefit plans.Changes in the Federal Transitional Reinsurance Program.  The Affordable Care Act included a transitional reinsurance program which reimburses plans for some high claims of individual market members.  This is a transitional program which gradually phases out with fewer claims reimbursed in 2015 than 2014.  This increases the claims that must be covered by the premium rates.Changes in Federal ACA tax. There are a number of taxes, fees, and assessments which are included in the rates our members pay.  One of those, the federal ACA tax, is projected to be 2.4 percent of HPIC premiums in 2015, a slight increase over the projected 2.0 percent of 2014 premiums.",Review Complete,10.30,85654MN022,HP Individual -NG,HealthPartners Insurance Company,MINNESOTA,MN,Annual,10.30,10.30,RC

The actuarial memorandum included, inter alia, actuarial assumptions, anticipated loss ratios, other information required by the ACA and appropriate actuarial certifications.INS has reviewed the submission in its entirety. However, INS has given special consideration in its review to the details of the Company&rsquo;s Part III Actuarial Memorandum, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template and the characteristics of the rating elements subject to the Federal regulations prescribed in 45CFR Part 147 paragraph 147.102.  Based on that review, INS has come to the following key conclusions:URRT Section 1 Experience Period Data&bull;	Earned premiums, incurred claims, allowed claims and index rate per member per month (PMPM) for the experience period, January 2013 through December 2013, appear lower than average&bull;	The completion method used to determine estimated incurred claims and allowed claims is consistent with accepted actuarial methods&bull;	HIC anticipates paying $938,596 in MRL rebates, based on its 2013 experience&bull;	Member months for the Experience Period, 148,154, is expected to decrease slightly to 126,174 for the Projection Period.URRT Section II Allowed Claims, PMPM Basis&bull;	Benefit Category descriptions closely follow the preferred descriptions of the URRT instructions&bull;	The utilization per 1,000 and the average cost/service factors by benefit category for the Experience Period appear to be  lower than average for the Individual market&bull;	The total allowed PMPM claim cost of $180.14 (Section II) matches the index rate of $180.00 (Section I) for the experience period (difference due to rounding)&bull;	The overall annual Trend assumption of 6.5%, projected for two years, appears to be reasonable.&bull;	HIC used a&lsquo;Population Risk Morbidity&rsquo; factor of 1.84 to project their underlying experience. The expected increase in morbidity is due to:1.	The inability to underwrite new entrants2.	Adverse Selection3.	Changes in the expected plan mixBased on the narrative and chart provided by the company, INS believes the 1.84 Morbidity factor to be reasonable&bull;	The&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factor used by HIC to project their underlying experience was set to 1.101. The main drivers behind this factor were:1.	Induced utilization2.	Additional benefits to meet the Essential Health Benefit (EHB) guidelines3.	Demographic changes4.	Changes in the geographic distribution of the membershipBased on the narrative and chart provided by the company, INS believes the 1.101&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factor to be reasonable.URRT Section II Credibility Manual&bull;	The basis of HIC&rsquo;s Credibility Manual is the company&rsquo;s own nationwide Individual health experience for 2013&bull;	The trend assumption used for the Credibility Manual, 6.5%, was the same assumption used for projecting the experience data&bull;	The&lsquo;Population Risk Morbidity&rsquo; and&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factors used for the Credibility Manual were fine-tuned slightly from those used to project the experience data in order to  adjust for using nationwide data&bull;	 Based on the narrative provided by the company, the development of the Credibility Manual appears reasonable.URRT Section III Projected Experience&bull;	HIC&rsquo;s&lsquo;Projected Allowed Experience Claims PMPM&rsquo; is based 64.5% on its projected actual experience and 35.5% on its Credibility Manual.  The method used to determine the credibility of the Experience Period data appears to be actuarially reasonable&bull;	The method used to determine the&lsquo;Paid to Allowed Average Factor in the Projection Period&rsquo; of 79.5% is actuarially acceptable and such average factor is consistent with the&lsquo;paid to allowed&rsquo; ratios at the plan level (before leveraging adjustment)&bull;	Companies are allowed to make a Risk Adjustment in developing its incurred claims on the URRT. Risk adjustment calculates a risk score for each plan participant, based upon age, sex and diagnosis. This is used to calculate the company&rsquo;s Plan average risk score. Because HIC anticipates its market level risk scores to be higher than the average risk score for Tennessee, it expects to receive a payment for having a higher risk population. Based on the narrative and spreadsheet provided by the company, INS believes the Risk Adjustment of $58.05 to be actuarially reasonable&bull;	The assumptions and methods used to determine the&lsquo;Projected ACA reinsurance recoveries, net of reinsurance premium, PMPM of $38.07 appear reasonable and consistent with accepted actuarial practice&bull;&lsquo;Administrative Expense Load&rsquo;,&lsquo;Profit&amp; Risk Load&rsquo; and&lsquo;Taxes&amp; Fees&rsquo; appear reasonable for the Individual market&bull;	The&lsquo;Index Rate for Projection Period&rsquo; of $420.40 matches the 2015&lsquo;Projected Allowed Experience Claims PMPM&rsquo;.

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 14.9%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 20,211 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.For Product 61430KS015 the current enrollment is 5,262. These members will have an approximate rate increase of 14.5%.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 7.2%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For policies issued to indviduals in Kansas, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&#61623; The cost for an inpatient hospital admission has increased 12.6%.&#61623; The cost for an outpatient hospital service has increased 3.7%.&#61623; The cost for phsycian services has increased 3.2%.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer individuals in Kansas a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes decreased expected medical costs by an average of 2.1%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&#61623;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&#61623; Changes to required taxes and fees&#61623; Phase-out of the Transtional Reinsurance Program which increases rates for plans issued to individualsWill Premiums for All Individuals Increase 14.5%?No, the 14.5% is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down, others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the subscriber chooses, the number of members and their ages, where in Kansas the subscriber is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Individual business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Coventry's secure member portal, My Online Services, which was designed to empower our members to become more involved in their health care by allowing them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services. Additionally, Aetna&rsquo;s Plan for Your Health website aims to educate all consumers, not just Aetna and Coventry members, on how to take advantage of their health care benefits.",Review Complete,14.50,61430KS015,KS PPO - PD,Coventry Health and Life,KANSAS,KS,Annual,13.13,13.13,RC

(NAIC code number 55107) has applied to the Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services to adjust premium rates for its community-rated small group and individual qualified health plans.I. OVERVIEWThe rates being sought contain a zero percent operating margin for the health plan despite the health plan reporting operating losses in 2013 and a forecasted significant operating loss in 2014. The proposed rate adjustment is based on the need to adjust prospectively from the state&rsquo;s reduction of rates by 6.3% on small group qualified health plans and by 4.0% on individual qualified health plans for 2014, an increasing medical cost trend, and changes in the health insurance market driven by federal and state actions. Other contributing factors for the proposed 2015 rate adjustment include increases in fees, taxes and added coverage for new mandated benefits.Excellus Health Plan and related companies (EHP) provide health insurance and administrative services for about 1.8 million upstate New Yorkers in 39 counties. The proposed premium rates affect about 182,000 members or 10% of the health plan&rsquo;s total membership. Its proposed rates are subject to review by the New York Department of Financial Services pursuant to section 4308c of the New York Insurance Law. The Department may approve the proposed rate increase as requested, modify the proposed rate increase, or disapprove the proposed rate increase in its entirety. The determination by the Department shall be supported by sound actuarial assumptions and methods.The rate application will be filed with the Department on or about June 13, 2014. The actual rate increases approved by the Department will be communicated to the impacted parties at least 60 days prior to the date the new rate is implemented for the subscriber. EHP policyholders with renewal dates during 2015 would, if approved, receive the indicated rate adjustments on their next anniversary date on or after January 1, 2015.Excellus Health Plan is required by New York State law to develop rates that assume that at least 82% of premium revenue will be spent on health care costs in the direct pay market along with small groups, be actuarially sound, cover all claim costs, and provide a contribution to ensure adequate reserves. The percent of premium attributable to claims is referred to as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).Excellus Health Plan's MLR has been and continues to exceed the statutory minimums. In 2013, the MLR for Excellus Health Plan was 94.2% for individual direct pay and 91.0% for small groups. Under new reporting requirements for 2014, the three-year cumulative MLR is 94.4% for individual direct pay and 91.5% for small group qualified health plans. With the proposed rate adjustments, Excellus Health Plan's MLRs would remain well above the minimum levels. In the event the MLR falls below the required minimum, the health plan refunds any difference to policyholders.Periodic rate adjustments are necessary to secure the ability of Excellus Health Plan, or any insurer, to produce sufficient revenue and surplus for reserves to assure continued coverage and claim payments both for current health care needs, and potential catastrophic cost situations. Excellus Health Plan's reserves vary from year to year based on actual health care costs incurred. As of Dec. 31, 2013, the health plan had reserves equivalent to 2.5 months of claims and operating expense, and more than the minimum required by New York State law. These reserves are the insurance that assures payment even when costs run higher than anticipated, or emergencies or disasters occur, and should not be used as an alternative fund to temporarily reduce rate adjustments.In filing its rate application, Excellus Health Plan is sensitive to the fact that individuals and small businesses struggle to afford higher premiums. However, it is clear that an increase in premiums is necessary to assure the continued operations of the Plan and the viability of its product offerings. Because EHP already has a high MLR, failure to approve these rates would only lead to the need for even greater rate increases in the future as claim costs would eventually exceed premiums collected.II. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASEEscalating health care costsThe cost of health care services, equipment and products continues to be the primary reason for rate increases.Trend is a very important consideration in determining the need for a premium rate adjustment. Upstate New York is not immune to national trends in health care costs given our state&rsquo;s population and demographics. Industry experts such as Segal Consulting and Buck Consultants are forecasting a 7.2-10.4% medical benefit trend nationwide for 2014. EHP is forecasting an overall medical benefit trend factor for its commercial fully insured business of 6.8% for 2014-2015. The trend forecast takes into account projected increases in costs attributed to what Excellus Health Plan pays out in claims expenses for hospital inpatient and outpatient care, professional services, pharmacy benefits and other goods and services. The health plan&rsquo;s anticipated changes in medical benefit spending are summarized as follows:Hospital inpatient, 6.9%Hospital outpatient, 6.4%Professional services, 4.5%Pharmacy, 10.6%Other medical goods and services, 7.5%These trends do not include adjustments to base rates for previous rate increases that were insufficient to cover claims and operating expenses for some plan options.Health care costs for each of those benefit components take into account the compounding effects of both the price of the goods or services provided as well as the quantity of the goods and services consumed.The impact that each trend has to the overall cost of coverage is related to proportionate size of the benefit component. For example, overall spending would rise faster as a result of a 5% increase in professional services versus a 5% increase in drug costs because professional services represents a larger share of medical benefit spending.III. NEW YORK TAXES AND ASSESSMENTSInsurance taxes are built into the costs of health coverage. New Yorkers who voluntarily purchase private health insurance coverage paid more than $4 billion in state health taxes in 2011, according to an analysis by the New York State Conference of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans.New York&rsquo;s Health Care Reform Act of 1996 (HCRA) created two surcharges on health insurance and an additional tax is imposed under Section 206 (formerly Section 332) of the state Insurance Law.The covered lives assessment is an annual flat surcharge or tax on every person who has insurance coverage in the state. Health plans are assessed on the basis of the number of people they cover with individual and family rates that vary depending on the residence of the insured. Among upstate regions defined by the state, the annual covered lives assessment rates in 2014 that impact Excellus Health Plan members are as follows:Per Certificate Per Year by region (Individual : Family)Western: $39.40: $130.03Rochester: $105.72: $348.87Central: $55.59: $183.46Utica-Watertown: $8.54: $28.17Northeastern: $39.94: $131.79The second surcharge created by the 1996 Health Care Reform Act is collected from health plans in the form of a sales tax on many hospital-related services. The surcharge is applied to both self-insured and fully insured plans. Beginning at 8.18% in 1997, the surcharge is now at 9.63%.The third levy, the Section 206 assessment, was originally established to finance New York State Department of Insurance operations but its funding purposes have expanded beyond that purpose. The assessments apply to all licensed insurers in the state (e.g. life, property and casualty, and health), and are based on New York premiums.In total, the above New York taxes and assessments including Section 206 aggregated to nearly 6% of the 2015 small group and individual qualified health plans&rsquo; premium.IV. FEDERAL TAXES, MANDATES AND ADJUSTMENTSAnnual fee on health insurance providers:Beginning in 2014, this fee is based on each health insurance company&rsquo;s market share of net premiums written, adjusted for size and corporate structure.The federal law requires the total fee on nationwide health insurance providers to be collected is:$8 billion in 2014,$11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016,$13.9 billion in 2017, and$14.3 billion in 2018.After 2018, the fee is expected to collect $14.3 billion, indexed to the rate of growth in premiums.Each year, the calculation will be based on the market share of each assessed plan and will change based on the number of companies in the insured market. Under this fee provision, a health plan could incur financial losses but would still be subject to the market share fee.For EHP, this fee increase represents a 1.2% increase to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans for 2015.Risk Adjustment Program:The risk adjustment program is a permanent provision that applies to both the individual and small group insurance market. This federal program assesses a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and uses the revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members.A fee of $0.96 per member per year is collected to fund the risk adjustment program. For EHP, this program reduces small group qualified health plans&rsquo; premiums by about 1.5%. For 2015, this program has no impact on the premium of individual direct pay qualified health plans.Transitional reinsurance program for the individual market:The federal law created a temporary reinsurance program that is to collect nationwide:$10 billion in 2014,$6 billion in 2015, and$4 billion in 2016.Additionally, a separate contribution is to be deposited into the U.S. Treasury that will total $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016.The contribution rate is to be based on a $44 national per capita yearly amount in 2015. All insurers and self- insured group health plans are required to contribute on behalf of all group health plans and health insurance coverage they provide. For EHP, this fee represents about 1% of premium but it is about 40% less than last year resulting in a 0.5% decrease to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans in 2015.For the individual qualified health plans, the federal government established reinsurance for excessive claims. The amount of money being distributed in 2014 is being reduced in 2015. At the same time, this reduction will require a 3.8% premium increase for individual qualified health plans.Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) fee:The federal law created the PCORI to help stakeholders make informed health decisions by advancing the quality and relevance of evidence-based medicine through the use of comparative clinical effectiveness research findings. The fee is set at $2 per year multiplied by the average number of lives covered under the plan for plan years ending before October 1, 2014. And, for plan years ending on or after October 1, 2014, the fee increases based on the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures.Federal mental health mandateThe federal requirements for coverage of mental health parity require a 0.2% increase to current premium to pay for required benefits in 2015.V. OPERATING EXPENSE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTSA portion of what is reported to the state as administrative expenses is attributed to what Federal Health Reform considers quality improvement expenses, meaning the federal government recognizes that these represent costs that lead to overall improvements in health care versus simply a routine business expense, and as a result will be considered a medical benefit expense for purposes of federal MLR calculations.Those quality improvement expenses include such items as:-Improvements in health outcomes brought about by case management and disease management programs,-Actions taken to help prevent hospital readmissions through such things as discharge planning and counseling,-Wellness and community health promotional activities, and-Health information technology that is used to help measure clinical effectiveness and predictive modeling.The proposed rates will more accurately reflect the true operating expense of administering the federal Health Care Reform legislation through the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange. The changes in the health insurance market required building and implementing an entirely new sales channel from what had primarily been a business-to-business marketplace.This required:-The implementation of a new sales call center that saw extended open enrollment deadlines in 2014,-The hiring of additional staff,-Increased direct-to-consumer communication costs to educate consumers about new products and how to access those products, and-The building and implementation of new products, new infrastructure for the continued improvements and changes to the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange and for the implementation of additional mandates for the federal Health Care Reform.Operating expenses - including quality improvement initiatives but excluding federal and state taxes, fees and assessments, and broker commissions - represent 8.7% of premium in small group qualified health plans and 8.4% in individual qualified health plans.VI. REGULATION 146Regulation 146 was a market stabilization mechanism for the individual and small group pools that was in effect prior to the adoption of the ACA. Similar to the ACA Risk Adjustment program, Reg. 146 attempted to equalize the risk within the small group and individual markets by assessing a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and used this revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members. Because of the redundancy with the new risk adjustment program, Reg. 146 is being phased out. The Department of Financial Services is requiring plans to distribute all outstanding compensations through premium adjustments in 2015 and 2016. This distribution plan results in a reduction in the small group qualified health plan premium of 0.3% and in individual premium of about 1%.",Review Complete,9.23,78124NY090,ExcellusBCBS EPO HDHP,"Excellus Health Plan, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Annual,20.68,20.68,RC

REGULATION 146Regulation 146 was a market stabilization mechanism for the individual and small group pools that was in effect prior to the adoption of the ACA. Similar to the ACA Risk Adjustment program, Reg. 146 attempted to equalize the risk within the small group and individual markets by assessing a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and used this revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members. Because of the redundancy with the new risk adjustment program, Reg. 146 is being phased out. The Department of Financial Services is requiring plans to distribute all outstanding compensations through premium adjustments in 2015 and 2016. This distribution plan results in a reduction in the small group qualified health plan premium of 0.3% and in individual premium of about 1%.",Review Complete,9.23,78124NY095,Univera EPO HDHP,"Excellus Health Plan, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Annual,21.13,21.13,RC

In addition our POS plans will not be offered on the SHOP.Financial experience of the product:  there is still not sufficient financial experience in 2014 to fully evaluate the performance of these plans.The section below was meant to comply with 45 CFR&sect;154.301(a)(4) that shows the items covered under the actuarial memorandum.(i)  The impact of medical trend changes by major service categories.  - We assumed a constant trend assumption across all major service categories.(ii)  The impact of utilization changes by major service categories.&ndash; We assumed a constant utilization adjustment across all major service categories.(iii) The impact of cost-sharing changes by major service categories including actuarial values.&ndash; For pricing benefit plans we used an outside consultant&rsquo;s model, calibrated to Kaiser&rsquo;s cost structure. With the exception of adding a credit for lab and x-ray services, removing elective abortion, no other changes were made to the existing benefits.  We did make a change to the model that recognizes the impact of copays better on utilization patterns,  this created some of the disruption between the historical pricing and future pricing.

They used their 2013 small group PPO experience as the basis for the 2015 premium rates. Premium rate increases range by product from about 3% to 20%. The key drivers of the rate increases are medical trend, adjustment for hepatitis C drugs, and benefit changes. The projected medical trend for the block is about 9.2%. Aetna provided a nationwide utilization study that demonstrated the utilization trends utilized in the rate development. Additionally, the unit cost projection factors were based on an internal model that evaluates the impact of provider contract changes. Aetna offers a multitude of plans and the variance is attributable to Aetna&rsquo;s independent evaluation of the paid-to-allowed ratio which is used in developing the pricing AVs for each plan.The expected federal Minimum Loss Ratio for the rates is 85%, which meets the federal requirements.Aetna has provided sufficient support for their assumptions and rating methodology.

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 14.7%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 2,546 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply.  Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal.  Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase.  We expect medical costs to go up 9%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below.  Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in Illinois, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&bull;	Cost per pharmacy prescription has gone up 16.8%&bull;	Cost for emergency room visits have increased 19.2%&bull;	The cost of home healthcare has gone up 38.6%What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsSeveral requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates.  These include:&bull;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&bull;	Enhanced network access standards&ndash; which limit our ability to control the cost and quality of medical care&bull;	Changes to required taxes and fees&bull;	Phase-out of the Transtional Reinsurance Program which increases rates for plans issued to individualsWill Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 14.7%?No, the 14.7% is an average.  Some premiums will increase by less or even go down.  Others will increase by more than the average.  The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling employees, and where in Illinois the group is located.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care.  These actions include:&bull;	Developing new agreements, arrangements, and  partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull;	Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have.

NCDOI&rsquo;s decision on the proposed rate increase was based upon the following:The filing complies with North Carolina laws and regulations, Federal laws, and applicable Actuarial Standards of Practice. The benefits provided are reasonable in relation to the proposed premiums charged.The insurer&rsquo;s assumptions used in projecting costs are reasonable.The insurer&rsquo;s projected experience supports the rate increase proposal.The proposed rate increase is not unreasonable based upon the expected claim payments, administrative expenses, and margin.The threshold rate increase is +10.09%.Premium rates are in compliance with ACA rating rules.NCDOI&rsquo;s determination included consideration of the following factors, as applicable:Medical cost trend changesChanges in utilization of services (i.e., hospital care, pharmaceuticals, doctors&rsquo; office visits)Cost-sharing changesChanges in benefitsChanges in enrollee risk profileImpact of over- or under-estimate of medical trend in previous years on the current rateReserve needsAdministrative costs related to programs that improve health care qualityOther administrative costsApplicable taxes and licensing or regulatory fees including ACA fees and assessmentsMedical loss ratioThe insurer&rsquo;s capital and surplus",Not Applicable,"SummaryCoventry is filing rates for Small Group plans in Norht Carolina. This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 11.21% for POS products (56346NC002) and 10.70% for HMO products (56346NC001).Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 3,000 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 9.8% year over year excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in North Carolina, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&#61623; The cost for an outpatient hospital service has increased 10%.&#61623; The cost for an inpatient hospital admission has increased 5.4%.&#61623; Costs for pharmacy prescriptions are increasing 7% year over year due to the release of Sovaldi for Hepatitis-C patients.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer North Carolina small businesses a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements, as well as to comply with the metal value requirements for small group plan designs. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes increased expected medical costs by an average of 2.5%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&#61623;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing (also known as the Federal Transitional Policy)&#61623; Enhanced network access standards&ndash; which limit our ability to control the cost and quality of medical care&#61623; Changes to required taxes and feesWill Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 11.21% or 10.70%?No, the stated increases are averages. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down. Others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling employees, where in North Carolina the group is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that groups pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have.

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 25.3%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 27,700 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply.  Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal.  Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase.  We expect medical costs to go up 11.9%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below.  Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in New York, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&bull;	The cost for an inpatient hospital admission has increased 7.3%.&bull;	Expenses for emergency treatment have increased 14.8%.&bull;	Expenses related to Physician services have gone up 7.4%.&bull;	Outpatient mental health costs have gone up 7.9%.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer New York small businesses a variety of plans to choose from.  We are changing some benefits for these plans in 2015, and on average, the benefit and cost sharing will change medical costs by an average of 2%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates.  These include:&bull;	Enhanced network access standards&ndash; which limit our ability to control the cost and quality of medical care&bull;	Changes to required taxes and feesWill Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 25.3%?No, the 25.3% is an average.  Rate changes differ by product due to the impact of benefit changes.  These average increase are:&bull;	26.1% for Product 17210NY008&bull;	25.3% for Product 17210NY009In addition, some premiums will increase by less or more than the average.  The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the family size for enrolling employees, and where in New York the group is located.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members.

By pooling the populations covered by our products, we protectindividuals from the unaffordable and potentially ruinous costs associated with significantillnesses or injuries. Our products promote preventive care, health maintenance and healthimprovement, and we have in place strong utilization management programs that supportmembers who require medical care and assure that they have access to high value care whileavoiding unnecessary costs.BCBSVT also works with providers to dampen cost increases through reimbursement strategiesthat include incentives to both provide and properly manage care. BCBSVT&rsquo;s vision is atransformed health care system in which every Vermonter has health care coverage, andreceives timely, effective, affordable care. None of this work is possible unless BCBSVTremains financially strong, and that requires that we be allowed to charge rates that coverthe medical expenses of the populations we serve.The purpose of this rate filing is to provide the rates and a description of the ratedevelopment for the products that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont (BCBSVT) isproposing to be offered in the Vermont Exchange, effective January 1, 2015.&bull; BCBSVT is proposing an average rate increase of 9.8 percent across all Exchange plans.This ranges from a 4.8 percent increase to an 11.8 percent increase.&bull; There are an estimated 35,037 contracts (57,867 members) currently enrolled withBCBSVT in a Qualified Health Plan.Significant medical price increases were partially offset by favorable membership assumptionsand reductions in BCBSVT administrative expenses. Combined, these factors produced a 3.3percent increase in rates. The remainder of the 9.8 percent increase was driven by changesrelated to federal and state health care reforms, including an increase in the federal fee thatis included in Exchange pricing, a reduction in federal subsidies of the premiums on Vermont&rsquo;snew Exchange, and a modest expansion of dental benefits for children.&bull; The federal government assesses a charge on all health plans to subsidize Exchangecoverage for the three year-period between 2014 and 2016, through its TransitionalReinsurance Program. The subsidy is reduced in 2015 and 2016, before beingeliminated entirely in 2017. Because the premium subsidy is being reduced from anestimated seven percent to an estimated three percent in 2015, it will require groupsand members to pay 4.0 percent more for their coverage.&bull; The federal insurer fee established by the Affordable Care Act is used to providesubsidies to low-income people to help them afford to purchase Exchange products.This fee is increasing by more than 40 percent, resulting in a 0.9 percent increase inpremium for Exchange products.&bull; The Green Mountain Care Board approved a change to enhance coverage for dentalservices for children. The change provides that children covered through the non-CDHPExchange products will have access to cleanings and other services with no costsharing requirement. The enhancement in coverage raises the premium by 0.5percent.&bull; Most deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums and co-pays in Exchange plans remainunchanged from 2014 to 2015. As overall costs increase and the amounts that memberspay in cost-sharing contributions stays the same, more of the total cost is transferredto premiums. This had an impact of 0.8 percent on premium.These four items drive an increase of 6.3 percent required solely because of mandatedchanges associated with the Affordable Care Act and Vermont benefit decisions.In the absence of mandated changes associated with the Affordable Care Act and Vermontbenefit decisions, a 3.3 percent increase would have been requested:&bull; An estimate of increases in the amounts providers are paid was included in 2014Exchange rates. Increases beyond those assumptions that have already occurred in2014, or that are projected to occur before the end of 2014, drive a premium increaseof 2.9 percent. This primarily includes hospital payments under budgets approved bythe Green Mountain Care Board and prescription drug prices.&bull; Amounts providers are paid are expected to increase by 4.8 percent in 2015. Thisincrease flows directly to premium.&bull; BCBSVT assumes that&ldquo;new members&rdquo; who have or will enroll in our qualified healthplans will prove to be significantly healthier on average than those previously insuredin individual and small group products. This assumption creates a premium decrease of2.5 percent.&bull; Other adjustments to the assumptions used in the 2014 rate development cumulativelyhave the effect of reducing the required rate increase by 1.8 percent. These includeitems such as updating the experience base to calendar year 2013 and observing themix of membership actually enrolled on the Exchange in 2014. Notably, BCBSVT has:o Reduced the projected medical utilization&ldquo;trend&rdquo; (the expected increases inoverall medical use) to zero,o Reduced its administrative expense fees, ando Included a one percent contribution to reserves, an amount that is lower thanit would normally require for the protection of Exchange members.BCBSVT understands the importance of adequately funding our health care system, to keep itstrong and accessible. Since the factors driving this rate increase are almost entirely relatedto federal policy changes and increases in prices paid to medical providers in Vermont, webelieve that there is no way to further reduce these rates without underfunding the healthcare coverage on which Vermonters rely",Review Complete,7.70,13627VT032,EPO,Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont,VERMONT,VT,Annual,11.31,11.31,FJCS

Under Maryland law, rates may not be inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.  Each rate filing is reviewed on its own merits.  The Commissioner&rsquo;s rate decisions must be based on statistical analysis and reasonable assumptions.  To assist the Commissioner in making these decisions, Maryland Insurance Administration (&ldquo;MIA&rdquo;) actuaries examine the data, methods and assumptions used by each insurer, non-profit health service plan, or HMO (&ldquo;carrier&rdquo;).  They review numerous factors related to proposed premium rates, including the carrier&rsquo;s actual and projected claims experience, medical and prescription costs, administrative costs, and profits or losses.  The Commissioner also considers the impact premium rates will have on Maryland consumers.  Under the federal Affordable Care Act and Maryland law, in the individual and small group markets, 80 cents of every premium dollar must be spent on paying claims or on quality improvement activities that figure increases to 85 cents in the large group market.  If an insurance carrier does not meet these targets, the carrier must pay rebates to policyholders.Modifications to Requested Premium Rates and Basis of ModificationsGroup Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc. submitted a rate filing on May 1, 2014, requesting an average rate increase of 38.1%.  On May 23, 2014, the Company amended its filing to request an average rate increase of 30.2%.  The amended rate filing reflected certain minor adjustments in response to MIA objections, such as modifying its assumptions about projected average age and the projected cost and utilization of dental benefits.  The most significant change, however, was a reduction in the Company&rsquo;s projections about the morbidity of its 2015 individual market enrollees as compared with the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  Specifically, in its amended filing, the Company assigned to its projected 2015 individual market enrollees a morbidity factor that was 1.60 times the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  In its May 1, 2014 filing, the Company had assumed a morbidity factor of 1.75.  The MIA proceeded to review the amended May 23, 2014 filing.The MIA concluded that certain of the Company&rsquo;s data, methods, and assumptions were not well supported, including certain assumptions about the projected morbidity of its individual product enrollees in 2015.  In particular, the Company had not adequately supported its assumptions regarding the number of small group enrollees projected to migrate to its individual products, or its assumptions about the morbidity levels of previously uninsured enrollees.  The MIA further concluded that the Company&rsquo;s actual experience during the first half of 2014, as well as other considerations relating to actual and projected enrollment in the 2014 and 2015 individual market, did not support a 1.60 morbidity factor.  The Commissioner also concluded that the requested average premium rate increase of 30.2% would have an abrupt, substantial, and adverse impact on the approximately 12,714 Marylanders currently enrolled in Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s Affordable Care Act-compliant plans in the individual market, and would introduce a high level of volatility into Maryland&rsquo;s individual health insurance market.The MIA prescribed a morbidity factor of 1.40, rather than the Company&rsquo;s requested morbidity factor of 1.60.  This modification resulted in an approximately 10.6% reduction in the Company&rsquo;s proposed premium rates for 2015.As modified during the rate review process, Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s premium rates for 2015 reflect an approximately 16.2% increase as compared with its premium rates for 2014.&emsp;DeterminationPursuant to&sect; 11-603(c)(2) of the Insurance Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, the Commissioner has determined that the Company&rsquo;s premium rates,  as modified during the rate review process, are not inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.Rate Review Standards and ConsiderationsThe Insurance Commissioner approves health insurance rates in Maryland.

The rates set forth in this filing were calculated as directed in the MIA Order, and CareFirst believes that they are inadequate.Accordingly, while the rates in this submission are filed as directed by the MIA Order and based upon the prescribed morbidity factor of 1.40, the information contained in this Actuarial Memorandum reflects a morbidity factor of 1.60.1.	SCOPE AND RANGE OF THE RATE INCREASE: CF is proposing to raise annual premiums by 16.2%, prior to age band changes. (For CFI the proposed renewal is 11.9%.) The range is 13.6% to 20.1%. (For renewing customers, an age band change adds 2.6% to the renewal, on average, with a range of 0.0% to 4.7% for ages 22 and upwards per the CMS age curve.)The primary factors driving this proposed change in premium rates are:a)	Projected significant increase in membership volumes with average morbidities higher than 2014.b)	Migration in the pool of former enrollees in Maryland&rsquo;s high risk pool the Maryland Health Insurance Plan (MHIP).c)	An aging of the pool of members.d)	An increase in the cost of medical care delivery in the form of claims trend driven by increases in both unit cost and utilization.e)	An increase in the health insurer fee.2.	FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE OF THE PRODUCT: The incurred period is 1-1-13 through 12-31-13. Total premiums and allowed claims for the period were $53,936,342 and $62,972,468, respectively.A.	Changes in the Morbidity of the Population Insured: CareFirst calculated its proposed rates based upon a morbidity factor of 1.60 however, the rates in this filing are calculated based upon a morbidity factor of 1.40 as ordered by the MIA Order.CareFirst estimates a morbidity risk factor of 1.60 for 2015 as relayed through the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filings (SERFF) on 5-23-14. Our 1.60 factor was computed after consideration for the morbidity risk factor that was included in the 2014 filed and approved rates.  The morbidity risk factor projections are based upon the model that supported CareFirst&rsquo;s 2014 rate filings.  The model compares known and estimated allowed claims costs per member per month (pmpm) for 2013 to project the cost of various categories of the estimated 2015 membership.These categories are based upon the prior status of the 2015 membership - previous CareFirst members (medically underwritten under 65 Individuals, MHIP, Group) and New Entrants sorted by income (less than 200% FPL, greater than 200% FPL).  The risk factor for each category is expressed in terms of allowed claims pmpm cost, and is calculated by comparing the category pmpm claims cost to the 2013 CareFirst Individual membership pmpm cost.  More than 50% of the projected 2015 membership is included in categories supported by actual claims data supporting the previous CareFirst member categories.  The New Entrants&rsquo; categories use projected risk scores based upon a Hilltop study (Basic Health Plan) for the members less than 200% FPL and the Group factor for the greater than 200% FPL members. The Group factor is based upon the almost 250 thousand CareFirst Small Group members that have for decades been community rated and guaranteed issue as is now required under ACA for Individual enrollees. CareFirst&rsquo;s judgment is that this extremely large community rated, guaranteed issue small group pool of members is most representative of the New Entrants greater than 200% FPL.B.	Changes in Demographics: Comparing the overall CareFirst member-level average age as of 12-31-12 to 3-31-14, the average age has increased by 4.5 years from 34.0 to 38.5. Age factors will account for a portion of the corresponding increase in claims cost. We find the CMS age curve spread of 3 to 1 to be lower than the 4.5 to 1 that is more correlated with expected claims costs. We have therefore adjusted expected claims costs accordingly in the experience period (EP) index rate projection in the other category.C.	Trend Factors (Cost-Utilization): The proposed trend of 6.5% is a reduction of 270 basis points from 2014&rsquo;s 9.2%. The improvement is concentrated in outpatient hospital and prescription drug services which comprise 32% of total allowed claims.D.	Projected Loss Ratio: Our projected NAIC DICR for MLR purposes is 83.9%, above the 80.0% minimum of Public Health Service Act (PHSA) 218.3.	CHANGES IN MEDICAL SERVICE COSTS: The experience period index rate is a key component driving the renewal. Last year&rsquo;s implicit 2013 index rate was $211 ($193 x trend of 9.2%). The actual for 2013 is $199 for a favorable variance of -6%.4.	CHANGES IN BENEFITS: For CareFirst&rsquo;s Individual offerings in Maryland, our portfolio is not changing. We will still offer 15 benefit plans&ndash; 1 Young Adult-Catastrophic, 4 Bronze, 4 Silver, 4 Gold and 2 Platinum. We have recalculated the costs of Essential Health Benefits (EHB) as well as Non-EHBs.a)	Per COMAR 31.10.39 Utilization Review of Treatment for Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders, Bulletin 14-07 and due to the passage of SB 759-HB 783, Coverage for Autism Spectrum Disorders, we have calculated an increase in claims of $3 per member per month (PMPM) for 2015. This is largely for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) treatments and is a state-mandated EHB benefit. The $3 PMPM is derived from an incidence assumption of 1 in 68 children ages 1-19, an uptake rate of 1 in 3 and an intensity rate of $40,000 to $95,000 per year depending on age.b)	Other adjustments were made for pediatric dental, mandatory generics, a new hepatitis C prescription drug, Sovaldi, and maternity.c)	Other Adjustments: CareFirst (CF) is proposing to introduce an incentive program (IP) whereby members can earn medical expense debit cards of as much as $250 annually, for an individual ($650 for a family). The cards must be utilized for qualified medical expenses such as deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket costs. The scope includes all benefit plans within CF&rsquo;s portfolio, On and Off the Exchange. This is being done in a revenue-neutral way. That is, the cost to CF of the incentive payments was chosen such that they match the expected savings to CF from more efficacious health care delivery. HealthyBlue (HB) was first launched effective 10-1-10 with the objective of motivating and rewarding greater engagement by the member in his or her health, improved wellness and prevention and better provider coordination and quality. As we sought to respond to feedback about HB, subsequent versions were released on 1-1-12 and 10-1-12. This IP represents an evolution of the HB concept. Further, it joins the tenets of HB with our Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) program which was launched on January, 2011.Our aim is that this IP will improve our members&rsquo; health.d)	Included are decreases to claims costs for a change in our Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) in 2014.e)	Membership Projections: We had projected 58% of enrollment in HMO-based plans as of 12-31-14 in our 2014 filings. Actual data as of 4-10-14 indicates that HMO comprises 69% of our CFI members. We had also expected 5% of enrollment in Platinum plans versus actuals of 13%. We incorporated both of these facts in projecting 12-31-15 enrollment.f)	    For the Young Adult-Catastrophic plan, the deductible-out-of-pocket maximum has been raised from $6,350 to $6,600 per year.g)	Also, per HB 0625, oral chemotherapy coverage has been mandated. The cost of reducing cost shares to not exceed those of intravenous chemotherapy has been deemed negligible.h)	Diabetic supplies have been moved to $0 copays. The deductible applies for H.S.A. plans but not for non-H.S.A.s with negligible price impact.i)	    Retail Clinics such as urgent care centers will have reduced copays to match the PCP rather than specialist copay with negligible price impact.j)	    A 5-tiered structure (Generics-Preferred, Generics-Non-Preferred, Brand Name-Preferred, Brand Name-Non-Preferred, Specialty) is currently used for approximately 20% of our benefits. This is changing to 4-tier structure by collapsing the Generics tiers.5.	ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED CONTRIBUTION TO RESERVE: The 2015 desired incurred claims ratio (DICR) is 79.3%.A.	Administrative Expense Load: PMPMs increased by 3% versus 2014.B.	CtR&amp; Risk Margin: Remains at 0.0%, break-even.C.	Taxes and Fees:I.	Community Health Investment of 2.0%.II.

As of at the end of March 2014, there are 216 policyholders or 386 members.Average rate increase is 19.4 percent based on the enrollments as of the end of March 2014.Average rate increase is 19.6 percent based on the 2015 projected enrollments.Annual rate increases will range from negative15.9 percent to 47.7 percent.For non-tobacco users, Annual rate increases will range from 12.2 percent to 37.9 percent.Financial experience of the productSince these plans are effective beginning in January 1, 2014, there is no full year experience available now. At the time 2014 rates were filed, the transitional policy was not known and the rates were set based on the assumption that all non-grandfathered groups would renew into the ACA pool throughout 2014.On March 5, 2014, CCIIO issued a bulletin extending transitional policy for two years to policy years beginning on or before October 1, 2016.  As a result, we expect to see more anti-selection to the ACA pool. We believe that most groups will continue to maintain grandfathered or transitional products except some currently highest-cost employers.We believed the 2014 rates were underpriced. There are a lot of uncertainties in the ACA pool. We decided to rely on the ACA Premium Stabilization Programs - the 2 Rs that apply to the small group market - and not increase rates so much that a death spiral becomes self-fulfilling.Changes in Medical Service CostsThe annualized allowed claims trend is projected to be 7.5 percent.41.9 percent of it is due to a rise in unit cost per service,23.8 percent of it is due to a rise in utilization,34.3 percent of it is due to other factors.Changes in benefitsMarket Gold 2000 HSA - no benefit change was made from 2014 to 2015.Market Silver 3530-2000 - The drug design of this plan was changed from 2014 to 2015.  The impact of product changes was calculated according to the proposed rule in 45 CFR 148.122 g. It will be treated as the same plan because the change is less than 2 percent.Administrative costs and anticipated profitsWe anticipate administrative costs to decrease by about 2.4 percent of premium, taxes and fees to increase by about 3.5 percent of premium, Profits and risk load to increase by about 0.7 percent of premium.",Review Complete,19.63,99969OH005,MedMutual Connect Small Group,Medical Health Insuring Corp. of Ohio,OHIO,OH,Annual,19.63,19.63,RC

Therefore, the IID approved the WHPI filing.",Not Applicable,"URRT Part II Description of Requested Rate IncreaseWellmark Health Plan of IowaIndividual HealthEffective January 1, 2015Scope and Range of Rate IncreaseWellmark Health Plan of Iowa, Inc has 2,177 policyholders representing 3,212 members in individual Affordable Care Act, ACA, plans as of May 2014.  The requested average rate increase for all of these plans is 11.9%, and will be effective January 1, 2015. The rate increase varies by plan and region, with a low of 5.9% and a high of 17.5%.  Subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate changes will vary depending on the benefit plan selected, age of the members on the policy, and dependent coverage.Financial Experience of the ProductThese ACA plans were introduced in 2014, and so as of the time of this rate request, there is only a limited amount of experience data available.  Rates for 2015 were therefore based on experience from Wellmark&rsquo;s existing individual business, and projected member movement from the entire insured and uninsured population.From the little claims experience that was available at the time of this rate request, the claims experience is higher for this business than was projected last year.  Therefore the majority of the rate request is due to higher expected claims experience.The proposed rate increase is expected to produce a medical loss ratio, MLR, of 88.8%.  It should be noted that the projected MLR meets the minimum requirement of 80.0% defined in the ACA.  If the actual MLR were to fall below this level, such as if actual claim costs turn out to be lower than expected, Wellmark would pay rebates to members as required by the ACA.Changes in Medical Service CostsAnnual trend of 4.1% was used to project claims from the experience period into the rating period.

There are now any 2 office exam occurrences at a $0 copay instead of 2 primary care office exam occurrences at a $0 copay, and there is an inclusion of a drug card with a tier 1 copay of $15 instead of all drugs applying deductible and coinsurance.Administrative Costs and Anticipated ProfitsThe main drivers of administrative expenses are employee salaries and benefits, broker and agent commissions, and various governmental taxes and fees. We strive to lower our administrative expenses, as well as the underlying cost of care, in order to provide the best value to our customers.For this rate request, administrative costs in aggregate have decreased as a percent of premium from the prior rating period. The same holds for anticipated profit, as it was reduced from 3.3% in the prior rating period to 0.0% in the projected rating period.

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 14.3%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 7,627 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.For Product 65598KS016 current enrollment is 840. These members will have an approximate rate increase of 15.8%.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 7.3%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer individuals in Kansas a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes decreased expected medical costs by an average of 3.0%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&#61623;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&#61623; Changes to required taxes and fees&#61623; Phase-out of the Transtional Reinsurance Program which increases rates for plans issued to individualsWill Premiums for All Individuals Increase 15.8%?No, the 15.8% is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down.  Others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the subscriber chooses, the number of members and their ages, where in Kansas the subscriber is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Individual business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Coventry's secure member portal, My Online Services, which was designed to empower our members to become more involved in their health care by allowing them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services.

We found no instances where the assumptions or pricing factors were unreasonable or inconsistent with market reform implementation constraints and guidelines.  The development process of the index rate through the consumer adjusted index rate was compliant with the federal instructions and the calibrations are justifiable.The projected medical loss ratio was 88.9%, was calculated according to the federal instructions, and exceeds the minimum of 80%.We believe that the requested rate increase is not unreasonable.",Not Applicable,"URRT Part II Description of Requested Rate IncreaseWellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of IowaIndividual HealthEffective January 1 2015Scope and Range of Rate IncreaseWellmark Inc has 9360 policyholders representing 15062 members in individual Affordable Care Act ACA plans as of May 2014.  The requested average rate increase for all of these plans is 14.5%, and will be effective January 1 2015. The rate increase varies by plan and region, with a low of 6.4% and a high of 18.3%.  Subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate changes will vary depending on the benefit plan selected, age of the members on the policy, and dependent coverage.Financial Experience of the ProductThese ACA plans were introduced in 2014, and so as of the time of this rate request, there is only a limited amount of experience data available.  Rates for 2015 were therefore based on experience from Wellmark&rsquo;s existing individual business, and projected member movement from the entire insured and uninsured population.From the little claims experience that was available at the time of this rate request, the claims experience is higher for this business than was projected last year.  Therefore the majority of the rate request is due to higher expected claims experience.The proposed rate increase is expected to produce a medical loss ratio MLR of 88.9%.  It should be noted that the projected MLR meets the minimum requirement of 80.0% defined in the ACA.  If the actual MLR were to fall below this level such as if actual claim costs turn out to be lower than expected, Wellmark would pay rebates to members as required by the ACA.Changes in Medical Service CostsAnnual trend of 4.1% was used to project claims from the experience period into the rating period. This trend assumption includes any change in service costs and utilization. Multi year trend averages were reviewed to arrive at the assumed trend amount.Changes in BenefitsThere are three plans that have changes in their benefits effective with this filing for January 1, 2015.For CompleteBlue 3500 PPO the coinsurance changed from 40% to 30%, the out of pocket amounts changed from $6,250 for single and $12,500 for family to $6,600 for single and $13,200 for family, and the deductible of $250 was removed from the drug card along with changing the preferred specialty copay from $70 to $100.For myBlue HSA Silver 3200 PPO members now have benefits after the single deductible is met, and they no longer have to wait until the entire family deductible is met.For EnhancedBlue 1000 PPO  the preferred specialty copay for the drug card was changed from $70 to $100.Administrative Costs and Anticipated ProfitsThe main drivers of administrative expenses are employee salaries and benefits, broker and agent commissions, and various governmental taxes and fees. We strive to lower our administrative expenses, as well as the underlying cost of care, in order to provide the best value to our customers.For this rate request, administrative costs in aggregate have decreased as a percent of premium from the prior rating period. The same holds for anticipated profit, as it was reduced from 3.3% in the prior rating period to 0.0% in the projected rating period.

Based on emerging experience we have reevaluated our estimate and have revised it to 4.9%.Due to the release of expensive Hepatitis C treatments, we increased our projected prescription drug trend to 13.1%.Will Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 12.03%?No, the 12.03% is an average. Rate changes differ by product due to the impact of benefit changes. These average increases are:&#61623; 12.04% for Product 40733CA011 with 846,180 projected member&#8208;months&#61623; 8.22% for Product 40733CA009 with 1,902 projected member&#8208;months&#61623; 12.86% for Product 40733CA010 with 56 projected member&#8208;monthsSome premiums will increase by less or even go down. Others will increase by more. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling employees, and where in California the group is located.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to beless than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high&#8208;cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Aetna Navigator a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services.

1552024,20523,Small Group,ST,01/01/2015,false,12/29/2014,12/31/2014,Unreasonable,"AETN-129577528Company Name: Aetna Health of CaliforniaClass of Business: Small GroupProduct(s) Impacted: Small Group HMO (ACA-compliant)Proposed Rate Change: 17.3% (average annual increase)Implementation date of rate increase: 1/1/2015People Impacted: 75,264Discussion of Rates/Rate Increase FactorsThe Department&rsquo;s review of the relevant factors set forth in&sect;154.301(a)(3) included, among other factors, the relationship of the projected aggregate medical loss ratio to the federal medical loss ratio, whether assumptions on which the rate increase is based are supported by substantial evidence, whether the choice of assumptions on which the rate increase is based is reasonable, an analysis of past medical trends versus actual experience, the anticipated medical trend as it applies to the proposed rating period, and a review of the medical loss ratios.Aetna Health of California initially filed a proposed rate increase of 11.9% September 5, 2014, but amended the filing October 15, 2014 to reflect a proposed rate increase of 17.3%. The dominant causes of the proposed rate increase of 17.3% consist of a projected aggregate annual claims trend of 7.9%, a 6.0% increase for population risk morbidity adjustment, and a 4.6% increase for dual option HMO/PPO adjustment. Aetna&rsquo;s proposed rate increase translates to a projected unadjusted loss ratio of about 71% compared to its 2013 experience loss ratio of about 77% for this block of business. The Department review of assumptions on which the proposed rate increase is based finds that the projected aggregate medical loss ratio of 78% will be less than the minimum federal MLR of 80%.ConclusionThe Department determined the proposed average annual rate increase of 17.3% by Aetna Health of California is unreasonable. The Department requested that Aetna lower the rate increase from 17.3% to 9.2%, which would have resulted in about $24 million in savings to small group employers who will be impacted by the rate increase. Aetna rejected this request and will be implementing its proposed rate increase beginning January 1, 2015.","We had discussions with the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) actuaries where we explained our assumptions and reasoning for our Q1 2015 Small Group HMO rate filing. We respectfully disagree with their conclusion that our rate increase is unreasonable.  The projected Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) for our entire Small Group block, which consists of both DMHC-filed HMO products and CDI-filed PPO products (which are  typically purchased with the HMO products), exceeds the federal requirement.  In order to ensure long-term viability of our Small Group business in California, we believe it is both appropriate and necessary to coordinate the pricing of all products offered to small employers, and to evaluate the MLR in total.  The rates we filed reflect what we believe is needed to cover the healthcare costs for the products our customers purchase, which is a combination of both HMO and PPO offerings.","SummaryAetna is filing rates for Small Group plans in California. This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 17.41%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through March 2015. Approximately 9500 members are expected to enroll in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 5.5% excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in California, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&#61623; The unit cost for an inpatient hospital admission increased 8.5%&#61623; Capitation amounts for inpatient hospital have increased 19.4%What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsIn our 2014 pricing, we assumed morbidity would increase by 0.85%, relative to pre&#8208;ACA experience. Based on emerging experience we have reevaluated our estimate and have revised it to 6%.We offer California small businesses a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes increased expected medical costs by an average of 0.78%.Will Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 17.41%?No, the 17.41% is an average. Rate changes differ by product due to the impact of benefit changes. These average increases are:&#61623; 17.42% for Product 20523CA003 with 857,274 projected member&#8208;months&#61623; 17.19% for Product 20523CA004 with 45,201 projected member&#8208;monthsSome premiums will increase by less than the average. Others will increase by more. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling employees, and where in California the group is located.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business.

Premier was evaluated on its own, and SmartSense and SmartSense with Enhanced Rx were evaluated together.  The rest of the products were combined into one filing, along with their grandfathered counterparts.The historical trends for the allowed claims were analyzed and projected forward to the projection period.  Among the items analyzed were medical and pharmacy claims trend which includes increases in the prices of services as well as the consumption of services, deductible leveraging, durational impacts, plan mix, seasonality impact and benefit factor changes.As shown in the Unified Rate Review Template, there are several factors which contribute to a rate increase.  Our normal rate development process applies an overall combined medical and pharmacy trend to the historical claims.  We do not apply separate trends to each service category.  Therefore, the dollar amounts shown in Section II of Worksheet 2 of the Unified Rate Review Template are rough estimates based on an allocation of the rate increase to all areas proportionally to their historical experience.  However, the allocation shows that increases in all medical costs are approximately eighty percent of the rate increase, with increases in administration expenses comprising the bulk of the remainder.The actuarial memorandum in Part III provides greater detail about the historical experience and forecasted projections of the various policies.At Anthem Health Plans of Virginia we understand that these are difficult economic times, and we are committed to working to moderate the impact of rate increases on our members while continuing to provide access to high quality, affordable health care.

The actual increase experienced by a group upon renewal will vary depending on the age and gender makeup of the group, their location, the group&rsquo;s current underwriting status, their current plan, and the Affordable Care Act compliant plan they choose to select upon renewal.  The ranges of impacts due to rate changes requested in this filing are as a result of the following parameters.Elimination of rating groups due to the health status of their members.Elimination of gender rating.Changes to allow no greater than a 3 to 1 difference in premium between adult ages 21 to 64, and prescribed adult and child age rating factors established by HHS.Implementation of single year age bands for adults 21 to 64.Changes to the method of rating to calculate group rates at a member level.  Elimination of composite rating and counting no more than three child dependents toward a family premium.Changes in the pricing values of specific benefit designs.New geographic pricing regions and updated geography pricing factors that no longer allow or make use of a region&rsquo;s overall health status in pricing.Groups that are on plans below the minimum allowed benefit level or that will need to move to a more generous level of plan cost sharing as a result of ACA requirements.Groups that need to move to new plan designs to remain within mandated ranges in benefit levels, for example, prescribed metal levels of benefits.The impact for groups will range from a 41 percent reduction to a 284 percent increase.  This does not reflect any impacts due to member aging, and is based on the sample of 2013 groups that have renewed with us through March of this year.  This includes required benefit changes.  Before the required changes, the largest increase would be 249 percent.  The ultimate range of impacts will vary depending on the profile of groups that will continue to renew throughout the year, or changes in the age make-up of our groups.This filing impacts 233,950 members currently enrolled in our Small Group market as of March 2013.Financial Experience for the ProductIn 2010, BCBSNC collected 1108.8 million in revenue and paid 919.0 million in claims for Small Groups.  The operating income before federal income tax was 22.7 million or 2 percent of revenue.In 2011, BCBSNC collected 1067.0 million in revenue and paid 883.0 million in claims for Small Groups.  The operating income before federal income tax was 29.5 million or 2.8 percent of revenue.In 2012, BCBSNC collected 1024.3 million in revenue and paid 837.2 million in claims for Small Groups.  The operating income before federal income tax was 38.1 million or 3.7 percent of revenue.The projected rate action is estimated to result in 1211.5 million in revenue based on current membership with anticipated paid claims of 966.3 million 2014.  We expect this rate action to deliver a 3 percent of gross revenue in contribution to surplus prior to federal income tax.  Favorable financial experience has allowed us to reduce premiums by .2 percent.Changes in Medical Service CostsThe cost of providing medical care to our members is by far the largest portion of premium expense.  The following changes in medical service costs and utilization contribute to the overall rate increase.Increases in both unit costs and utilization of knee and hip surgeries.Increases in outpatient costs per visit of 8.1 percent, driven primarily by gastroenterology costs and orthopedic costs.Increases in outpatient utilization of .8 percent, driven by chemical dependency services.Increases in professional costs of 2.5 percent, driven heavily by treatment of GERD and colonoscopies, and endocrinology treatments for obesity.Increases in professional utilization of 1.1 percent, due to increases in office visits, including mental health treatment.Increases in pharmacy costs per prescription of 2.1 percent due to increases in use of high cost, specialty medications.  Increases in specialty drug costs alone rose by 15.5 percent in 2012 compared to a decline in non specialty drug costs on a per member per month basis.In total, changes in the underlying cost of providing medical services to our current members add 7.1 percent to our rate increase.Changes in utilization patterns, primarily driven by the elimination of copayments once the member out of pocket maximum is reached, and the overall expected risk of our Small Group pool in 2014 add an additional 1.5 percent combined.Changes in BenefitsAdditional benefits will add 4.7 percent to the rate increase in 2014.BCBSNC has developed new plans to remain compliant with the Affordable Care Act.  These plans eliminate dollar limits on any essential health benefits and implement out of pocket maximiums that limit any type of member of out of pocket cost, including copayments, as required by law.  Furthermore, groups will need to move to a plan compliant with federally required ranges for plan cost sharing or actuarial value. Upon renewal,  groups will be presented a renewal with a default plan most comparable to their current plan.  Groups will have a choice of any plan offered in the market, however, the rate increase presented in this filing reflects the extimated overall impact of the change in premium including any required changes in benefit design, as described above.  The required changes in design add 3.5 percent to the rate increase.  Please note that we have reduced the number of benefit designs offered in the market in order to comply with mandated levels of benefits, which means certain combinations of benefit levels currently offered in the market will no longer be available.Additionally, Small Group members will receive coverage of pediatric dental and vision benefits which add another 1.2 percent to the rate increase.  These benefits are required to be covered as essential health benefits under the Affordable Care Act.Changes in administrative costs and profitNew taxes and fees required by the Affordable Care Act have an impact on rates.  These include the Health Insurer Tax, Transitional Reinsurance Fee, the Federal Exchange User Fee, Patient Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund Fee, and the federal Risk Adjustment Program Fee.  In total, these fees and taxes add 2.3 percent to the premiums for Small Groups in 2014.  Groups renewing earlier in the year will be more adversely impacted by these taxes and fees than groups renewing later in the year.Other changes to non claims expenses such as administrative expenses, commission payments to brokers and agents, and contributions to surplus in total add 1.4 percent to the rate increase.Addressing AffordabilityBlue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina is committed to reducing medical premium costs for owners of Small businesses in North Carolina and improving the health of our policyholders.

Including adjustments for taxes, this is equivalent to an MLR of approximately 86.3%.Changes in Medical Service CostsThere are many different health care cost trends that contribute to increases in the overall U.S. health care spending each year.  These trend factors affect health insurance premiums, which can mean a premium rate increase to cover costs.  Some of the key health care cost trends that have affected this year&rsquo;s rate actions include:Coverage MandatesEstimated impacts of changes in benefit design and administration due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act mandates.  Direct impacts include the effects of specific changes made to comply with new laws both at the Federal and State level.Increasing  Cost of Medical ServicesAnnual increases in reimbursement rates to health care providers such as hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical companies.Increased UtilizationThe number of office visits and other services continues to grow.  In addition, total health care spending will vary by the intensity of care and or use of different types of health services. Patients who are sicker generally have a higher intensity of health care utilization. The price of care can be affected by the use of expensive procedures such as surgery vs. simply monitoring or providing medications.Higher Costs from Deductible LeveragingHealth care costs continue to rise every year, while deductibles and copayments remain the same.  As a result, a greater percentage of health care costs need to be covered by health insurance premiums each year.Cost shifting from the public to the private sectorReimbursements from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to hospitals are no longer covering all of the cost of care.  The cost difference is being shifted to private health plans. Additionally, Medicare and Medicaid rates to hospitals are expected to decline due to the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on Medicare and the affect of the recession on Medicaid.  A rate increase paid by Medicaid to hospitals is often below the actual cost increase hospitals will experience.Impact of New TechnologyImprovements to medical technology and clinical practice require use of more expensive services - leading to increased health care spending and utilization.Underwriting Wear offThe variation by policy duration in individual medical insurance claims, where claims are higher at later policy durations as more time has elapsed since initial underwriting.Administrative CostsGolden Rule works to directly control administrative expenses by adopting better processes and technology, and through the development of programs and innovations that make health care more affordable. We have led the marketplace by introducing key innovations that make health care services more accessible and affordable for customers, improve the quality and coordination of health care services, and help individuals and their physicians make more informed health care decisions.Additionally, Golden Rule indirectly controls medical cost payments by using appropriate payment structures with providers and facilities. Golden Rule&rsquo;s goal is to control costs, maximize efficiency, and work closely with physicians and providers to obtain the best value and coverage.In addition, increases in State and or Federal government imposed taxation and fees are another significant factor that impacts health care spending.A review of the current Golden Rule premium rate indicates that the rate is not sufficient to cover the expected benefit and administrative costs.

(INS) has reviewed the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (CGLIC) Individual Major Medical filing.This is a form filing to update premium rates for Form TNIND0210 that was submitted on June 26, 2013. The proposed change is the addition of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) required fees to premiums effective January 1, 2014. The updated rates replace the current medically underwritten and guaranteed issue rates, approved on April 3, 2012 with Tennessee Tracking Number H-120179.  This updated filing is subject to the requirements of the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance, and the Affordable Care Act.The filing consists of non-grandfathered plans, which will be closed to new business effective January 1, 2014. There will be no policy renewals on these plans. However, insureds in force as of December 31, 2013 will be permitted to continue on their current policy until their next renewal in 2014. Upon their renewal in 2014, insureds will not be permitted to renew their current plan, and will need to enroll in an ACA compliant plan to continue coverage. CGLIC plans to withdraw from the individual market on December 31, 2014, and therefore they will have no individual policies effective January 1, 2015.After a review of the actuarial memorandum and Unified Rate Review Template (URRT) filed in support of the subject rate filing, INS identified on August 15, 2013 several matters that required additional clarification. On August 22, 2013, CGLIC provided sufficient clarification which allowed INS to complete its review and analysis.In support of their request, CGLIC has provided policy forms, a list of covered benefits, plan descriptions, premium rates, the URRT and an actuarial memorandum. The actuarial memorandum included, inter alia, actuarial assumptions, anticipated loss ratios, other information required by the ACA and appropriate actuarial certifications.The change in the rates effective January 1, 2014 is the addition of the appropriate ACA regulatory fees, which are the $63 annual reinsurance fee ($5.25 PMPM), $2 annual patient centered outcomes research institute (PCORI) fee, and the 2.2% health industry fee. The aggregate impact on the premium is 5.05%.  After an analysis of the filing, INS believes that the addition of these fees is reasonable.Based on INS&rsquo;s review and on the certifying statements of CGLIC&rsquo;s opining actuary, INS deems CGLIC&rsquo;s proposed rates to be compliant with Tennessee and ACA regulations and suggests approval, pending any additional Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance review.",Not Applicable,"Preliminary Justification&ndash; Part 2Scope and range of the rate increase:For a healthy individual, Cigna's average new rate for an individual product will be $198. This is an increase of $24 from the average current rate. There are estimated to be 4,564 customers impacted by this rate increase over the course of the next year. The average increase a customer will see is 14%, and the percentage increase will vary from 11% to 16% by customer.The proposed rate increase consists of a 5.05% increase to cover additional fees as required by PPACA. The average increase a customer will see also includes the impact of trend.Financial Experience of Connecticut General Life Insurance Company Individual PPO Products:Loss ratios for this product have been in line with expectations. For this reason, the proposed rate change is only to increase the current filed fourth quarter rates on January 1, 2014 to incorporate the additional PPACA fees that will be required to be paid in 2014.How Legally Required Benefit Changes contribute to the rate increase:There have been no premium changes due to benefit changes in this filing.How administrative costs&amp; anticipated profits contribute to the rate increase:In addition to the cost of medical services, there are a number of indirect medical and non-medical costs that an insurance company has to pay. These costs include things like programs that promote the best level of care and health for a patient, payments that must be made to federal, state or local government authorities in the form of taxes or fees, assessments or subsidies that states charge to pay for public health programs, e.g. childhood vaccines, financial examinations by the government, prevention of healthcare fraud, payments to agents or brokers who help customers enroll in a health plan and other costs that all business have such as employees&rsquo; salaries, building upkeep, utilities, etc.PPACA regulations have also added additional fees, which are the reason for this filing. These fees include a $63 annual reinsurance fee, a $2 annual patient centered outcomes research institute fee and a 2.2% health industry fee.",Review Complete,5.00,46553TN027,TN IND Open Access Plus,Connecticut General Life Insurance Co,Tennessee,TN,Annual,13.80,13.80,RC

While the inception-to-date loss ratio, of 68.7%, is below the 80% medical loss ratio for individual health insurance defined in PPACA for rebate purposes, the loss ratio for 2012 is 78.4%, without Federal MLR adjustments.Upon analyzing the trend information contained within the rate filing, the Department has determined that the overall trend of 8.0% is appropriate.  The trend data provided for this rate filing generated an overall annual trend of 18.30% indicating that unit cost and utilization are accelerating from previous rate filings for this product.Claim lag triangles were analyzed to confirm the most recent estimates of incurred claims and the difference between incurred and paid.Based upon the finding of fact, and the summary information described above, the average rate increase request of 10.0% is approved as submitted.

This will affect approximately 10,073 Non-Grandfathered covered Individuals in the State of Connecticut.  An average rate increase of 15.0% is requested due to rising medical costs.

Including adjustments for taxes, this is equivalent to an MLR of approximately 103.6%.Changes in Medical Service CostsThere are many different health care cost trends that contribute to increases in the overall U.S. health care spending each year.  These trend factors affect health insurance premiums, which can mean a premium rate increase to cover costs.  Some of the key health care cost trends that have affected this year&rsquo;s rate actions include:Coverage MandatesEstimated impacts of changes in benefit design and administration due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act mandates.  Direct impacts include the effects of specific changes made to comply with new laws both at the Federal and State level.Increasing Cost of Medical ServicesAnnual increases in reimbursement rates to health care providers such as hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical companies.Increased UtilizationThe number of office visits and other services continues to grow.  In addition, total health care spending will vary by the intensity of care and or use of different types of health services. Patients who are sicker generally have a higher intensity of health care utilization. The price of care can be affected by the use of expensive procedures such as surgery vs. simply monitoring or providing medications.Higher Costs from Deductible LeveragingHealth care costs continue to rise every year, while deductibles and copayments remain the same.  As a result, a greater percentage of health care costs need to be covered by health insurance premiums each year.Cost shifting from the public to the private sectorReimbursements from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to hospitals are no longer covering all of the cost of care.  The cost difference is being shifted to private health plans. Additionally, Medicare and Medicaid rates to hospitals are expected to decline due to the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on Medicare and the affect of the recession on Medicaid.  A rate increase paid by Medicaid to hospitals is often below the actual cost increase hospitals will experience.Impact of New TechnologyImprovements to medical technology and clinical practice require use of more expensive services - leading to increased health care spending and utilization.Underwriting Wear offThe variation by policy duration in individual medical insurance claims, where claims are higher at later policy durations as more time has elapsed since initial underwriting.Administrative CostsGolden Rule works to directly control administrative expenses by adopting better processes and technology, and through the development of programs and innovations that make health care more affordable. We have led the marketplace by introducing key innovations that make health care services more accessible and affordable for customers, improve the quality and coordination of health care services, and help individuals and their physicians make more informed health care decisions.Additionally, Golden Rule indirectly controls medical cost payments by using appropriate payment structures with providers and facilities. Golden Rule&rsquo;s goal is to control costs, maximize efficiency, and work closely with physicians and providers to obtain the best value and coverage.In addition, increases in State and or Federal government imposed taxation and fees are another significant factor that impacts health care spending.A review of the current Golden Rule premium rate indicates that the rate is not sufficient to cover the expected benefit and administrative costs.

These trend factors affect health insurance premiums, which can mean a premium rate increase to cover costs.  Some of the key health care cost trends that have affected this year&rsquo;s rate actions include:&#61607;	Increasing Cost of Medical Services&ndash; Annual increases in reimbursement rates to health care providers&ndash; such as hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical companies.&#61607;	Increased Utilization&ndash; The number of office visits and other services continues to grow.  In addition, total health care spending will vary by the intensity of care and use of different types of health services. Patients who are sicker generally have a higher intensity of health care utilization. The price of care can be affected by the use of expensive procedures such as surgery vs. simply monitoring or providing medications.&#61607;	Higher Costs from Deductible Leveraging&ndash; Health care costs continue to rise every year, while deductibles and copayments remain the same.  As a result, a greater percentage of health care costs need to be covered by health insurance premiums each year.&#61607;	Cost shifting from the public to the private sector&ndash; Reimbursements from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to hospitals are no longer covering all of the cost of care.

These federal ACA requirements add costs to all consumers&rsquo; commercial health plans for 2014.Golden rule is including 0% margin for profits (after tax) into these rates for 2014. Thus they are pricing this block of business at a break-even level for 2014.These rate filings are only for the Non-Grandfathered (NGF) members enrolled on these plans.Grandfathered (GF) members enrolled on these plans have not yet received any approved rate increase for 2014. The prior rate filings (280386, 280387) requesting a 28.0% rate increase including GF members for the period November 2013 through October 2014 was not approved. The Division requested that Golden Rule split out GF members into their own rate filing going forward.These plans do not include members enrolled on Golden Rule&rsquo;s F.A.C.T. Association Group plans in Colorado. F.A.C.T. members have not yet received any rate increase for 2014.Golden Rule has submitted some documents in this filing as being&ldquo;Confidential&rdquo;, meaning that they are included in the filing to support the rate increase, but they are not available for public view.The Optional enhanced Supplemental Accident Benefit is receiving a 14.3% increase.Rate MethodologyThe CMM and H&amp;S products in this filing are being pooled for rate setting purposes.Experience Used for Rate Setting: Golden Rule included 3.5 years of experience for these NGF plans, from January 2010 through June 2013. The most recent 12 month incurred experience period used as the base in the projection calculation was July 2012 through June 2013:NGF Experience: 71.2% Loss Ratio based on an average of 17,377 covered lives.Golden Rule also provided the Federal Uniform Rate Review Template (URRT) which must accompany Individual NGF filings and be reported in HIOS. The URRT is not required for GF member filings and does not contain GF member experience. In the URRT Golden Rule provides experience for the 2012 calendar year period for NGF members. This 2012 NGF experience is also provided in the Colorado actuarial memorandum. The Federal URRT is not the official rating development or calculation. Rather it represents a standardized projected average premium calculation that is used by CMS for comparing and gauging premium development and rate changes. Following is a comparison of the 2012 experience in the URRT and in the Actuarial Memorandum.URRT:2012 NGF Experience: 67.0% Loss Ratio based on an average of 15,252 lives.Actuarial Memorandum:2012 NGF Experience: 67.4% Loss Ratio based on an average of 15,134 covered lives.Annual Health Cost Pricing Trend: 8.0%.Golden Rule submitted 4 years of Nationwide quarterly claim trend data split separately for Medical and Pharmacy. The data shows historical trends as well as normalized trends adjusted for demographic and benefit changes from period to period.2012 Medical Normalized Historic Trend: 7.7%2012 Pharmacy Normalized Historic Trend: 8.29%The 8.0% pricing trend falls in line with the normalized historic data. Note that commercial Individual claims trends may differ from general cost index increases due to cost sharing leveraging effects and other factors specific to a block of business and product type. The 8% pricing trend proposed by Golden Rule falls within the middle range of Individual business trends being used in 2014 in the Colorado Individual insurance market.Experience Consistency: The Division reviewed the reported loss ratios in specific quarters and periods:67.4% Loss Ratio for the 2012 experience period.66.5% Loss Ratio for the 1st. Half of 2013 experience period.71.2% Loss Ratio for the July 2012 to June 2013 experience period.The question was addressed as to why the loss ratio for the period from July 2012 through June 2013 could be larger than the loss ratio for the other two overlapping periods. The Division was able to verify that this data is correct and does not represent an error, it results from the fact that the 1st Half 2012 had a lower loss ratio than 1st half 2013. The first half of the year tends to be the lower due to seasonality, and the loss ratios from year to year have tended to increase as the block of business has matured and average policy duration has increased. Both of these are normal developments.Projection Calculation: Golden Rule provided a detailed projection calculation showing monthly premium and claims for both the experience period (July 2012&ndash; June 2013) and the new rating period (February 2014&ndash; December 2014). This calculation was submitted as being confidential. The projected loss ratios with and without the 13% proposed rate increases were:Experience Period Loss ratio: 71.4%Projected Loss Ratio Without Rate Increases: 87.5%Projected Loss Ratio With Rate Increases: 78.3%Target Loss Ratio Based on Needed Retention: 78.3%The increase from the experience period loss ratio of 71.4% to the projected rating period loss ratio of 87.5% (without rate increase) is primarily driven by 18 months of expected claims trend at 8% annual, and additional uwwo trend that Golden Rule is applying. Golden Rule provided as&ldquo;confidential&rdquo; some of the support for how their uwwo factors were developed. Based on an objection submitted from the Division, Golden Rule has now modified the impact of the uwwo factor from what was originally filed by building in an assumption that some older and sicker members will be more likely to move to an ACA Exchange plan in the 1st quarter of 2014. The average member duration through the projected period has been decreased to reflect this.Golden Rule has ceased to sell these plans to any new members commencing on January 1, 2014, because this is block of business is not ACA compliant for 2014. Golden rule did not file an ACA compliant block of business for 2014 in Colorado.Golden Rule is proposing rate increases in this filing to continue for NGF members through December 31, 2014, and has reflected this in their projections by assuming NGF members may stay on their plans throughout 2014 if they wish. This results in Golden Rule applying larger uwwo increases to claims projections for 2014 because these NGF members then have large uwwo factors accumulating throughout 2014. Since Golden Rule may not sell any new plans in 2014 the average plan duration increases throughout 2014.We reviewed the estimated reserves built into final claims for Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) claims. Levels for estimated IBNR claims were moderate and well within accepted levels for these benefit and product types.Premium Retained to Cover Expenses, Taxes Fees and ProfitsAdministrative costs: Expenses the insurance company pays to operate this insurance plan.This includes all expenses not directly related to paying claims, such as, but not limited to, salaries of company employees, the cost of the company&rsquo;s offices and equipment, commissionsto agents to sell and service policies, subsidies to cover legally required plans such as portability, and taxes.Profit: The amount of money remaining after claims and administrative expenses are paid. Margin is the comparable term for a nonprofit insurance company.For 2014 Golden Rule is requesting 0% profit levels after income tax, which is 0.9% profit before income tax.Additional federal ACA taxes and assessments have been imposed on issuers for 2014. These additional taxes and assessments imposed by the federal government have increased premiums for all consumers on commercial health plans in 2014. Golden Rule has proposed keeping 4.025% of member&rsquo;s premiums to cover these taxes. This includes the typical $5.25 pmpm to cover Transitional Reinsurance program fees, and 1.6% to cover the federal Health Insurer Fee (HIF). These levels are typical to what other issuers are collecting from members. Without the additional taxes and fees Golden Rule&rsquo;s retention level would only be 17.7%.Total average premium retention is 21.7% shown as follows:% of PremiumA.

The Division asked Golden Rule for the impact of these members leaving in their projection. Golden Rule modified their projections and indicated the following:&ldquo;In order to model the higher cost members moving to an ACA compliant plan in 2014, we have modified our projection to apply the shock lapse to our highest duration members. Members at lower durations generally have lower claims due to underwriting. Thus, we have applied our additional shock lapse only to those members at the highest durations to simulate members with higher claims moving to an ACA compliant plan in 2014.&rdquo;The Division previously objected to the large claims adjustment that increases the estimated cost of members in these plans. Golden Rule has made support for the large claims adjustment confidential in this filing. This adjustment has now been reduced in the final projection in comparison to what was submitted in prior filings.Golden Rule was able to address all other Division objections from this filing, and prior disapproved filings.Disapproved Rate ChangesThe Division has approved the 13.0% rate increase and all modified rate adjustments as noted in the Rate Change Summary section above.The Division is reviewing letters for the rate increase under state tracking 282459.

The closed non-grandfathered products from 2013, upon which these rates were based, had total premiums and allowed claims for the incurred period of 1-1-13 through 12-31-13 of $27,256,197 and $34,336,811.The primary factors driving this proposed change in premium rates are:a) Projected significant increase in membership volumes with average morbidities higher than 2014.  CareFirst estimates a morbidity risk factor of 1.35 for 2015.    The morbidity risk factor projections are based upon the model that supported CareFirst&rsquo;s 2014 rate filings.  The model compares known and estimated allowed claims costs per member per month (PMPM) for 2013 to project the costs of various categories of the estimated 2015 membership.b) An aging of the pool of members.  The age of GHMSI PPO members changed by increasing 2.3 years, from 35.6 to 37.9.c) An increase in the cost of medical care delivery in the form of claims trend driven by increases in both unit cost and utilization.  See description in section 3.d) An increase in the Health Insurer Fee.  See description in section 4.Our projected loss ratio for MLR purposes is 84.2%, above the 80.0% minimum of Public Health Service Act (PHSA) 218.3. Changes in Medical Service CostsThe proposed trend of 9.0% is a decrease of 190 basis points from 2014&rsquo;s 10.9%.4. Changes in BenefitsAdjustments have been made for pediatric dental, mandatory generics, a new Hepatitis C prescription drug called Sovaldi and maternity.CF is proposing to introduce an incentive program (IP) whereby members can earn medical expense debit cards of as much as $250 annually, for an individual ($650 for a family). The cards must be utilized for qualified medical expenses such as deductibles, copays and out-of-pocket costs. The scope includes all benefit plans within CF&rsquo;s portfolio, On and Off the Exchange. This is being done in a revenue-neutral way.Retail Clinics such as urgent care centers will have reduced copays to match the PCP rather than specialist copay with a negligible price impact.Included in this calculation is a decrease to claims costs for a change in our Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) in 2014.5. Administrative Costs and Anticipated Contribution to ReserveThe 2015 desired incurred claims ratio (DICR) has changed from 79.6% (2014) to 80.5% (2015).A.

(NAIC code number 55107) has applied to the Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services to adjust premium rates for its community-rated small group and individual qualified health plans.I. OVERVIEWThe rates being sought contain a zero percent operating margin for the health plan despite the health plan reporting operating losses in 2013 and a forecasted significant operating loss in 2014. The proposed rate adjustment is based on the need to adjust prospectively from the state&rsquo;s reduction of rates by 6.3% on small group qualified health plans and by 4.0% on individual qualified health plans for 2014, an increasing medical cost trend, and changes in the health insurance market driven by federal and state actions. Other contributing factors for the proposed 2015 rate adjustment include increases in fees, taxes and added coverage for new mandated benefits.Excellus Health Plan and related companies (EHP) provide health insurance and administrative services for about 1.8 million upstate New Yorkers in 39 counties. The proposed premium rates affect about 182,000 members or 10% of the health plan&rsquo;s total membership. Its proposed rates are subject to review by the New York Department of Financial Services pursuant to section 4308c of the New York Insurance Law. The Department may approve the proposed rate increase as requested, modify the proposed rate increase, or disapprove the proposed rate increase in its entirety. The determination by the Department shall be supported by sound actuarial assumptions and methods.The rate application will be filed with the Department on or about June 13, 2014. The actual rate increases approved by the Department will be communicated to the impacted parties at least 60 days prior to the date the new rate is implemented for the subscriber. EHP policyholders with renewal dates during 2015 would, if approved, receive the indicated rate adjustments on their next anniversary date on or after January 1, 2015.Excellus Health Plan is required by New York State law to develop rates that assume that at least 82% of premium revenue will be spent on health care costs in the direct pay market along with small groups, be actuarially sound, cover all claim costs, and provide a contribution to ensure adequate reserves. The percent of premium attributable to claims is referred to as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).Excellus Health Plan's MLR has been and continues to exceed the statutory minimums. In 2013, the MLR for Excellus Health Plan was 94.2% for individual direct pay and 91.0% for small groups. Under new reporting requirements for 2014, the three-year cumulative MLR is 94.4% for individual direct pay and 91.5% for small group qualified health plans. With the proposed rate adjustments, Excellus Health Plan's MLRs would remain well above the minimum levels. In the event the MLR falls below the required minimum, the health plan refunds any difference to policyholders.Periodic rate adjustments are necessary to secure the ability of Excellus Health Plan, or any insurer, to produce sufficient revenue and surplus for reserves to assure continued coverage and claim payments both for current health care needs, and potential catastrophic cost situations. Excellus Health Plan's reserves vary from year to year based on actual health care costs incurred. As of Dec. 31, 2013, the health plan had reserves equivalent to 2.5 months of claims and operating expense, and more than the minimum required by New York State law. These reserves are the insurance that assures payment even when costs run higher than anticipated, or emergencies or disasters occur, and should not be used as an alternative fund to temporarily reduce rate adjustments.In filing its rate application, Excellus Health Plan is sensitive to the fact that individuals and small businesses struggle to afford higher premiums. However, it is clear that an increase in premiums is necessary to assure the continued operations of the Plan and the viability of its product offerings. Because EHP already has a high MLR, failure to approve these rates would only lead to the need for even greater rate increases in the future as claim costs would eventually exceed premiums collected.II. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASEEscalating health care costsThe cost of health care services, equipment and products continues to be the primary reason for rate increases.Trend is a very important consideration in determining the need for a premium rate adjustment. Upstate New York is not immune to national trends in health care costs given our state&rsquo;s population and demographics. Industry experts such as Segal Consulting and Buck Consultants are forecasting a 7.2-10.4% medical benefit trend nationwide for 2014. EHP is forecasting an overall medical benefit trend factor for its commercial fully insured business of 6.8% for 2014-2015. The trend forecast takes into account projected increases in costs attributed to what Excellus Health Plan pays out in claims expenses for hospital inpatient and outpatient care, professional services, pharmacy benefits and other goods and services. The health plan&rsquo;s anticipated changes in medical benefit spending are summarized as follows:Hospital inpatient, 6.9%Hospital outpatient, 6.4%Professional services, 4.5%Pharmacy, 10.6%Other medical goods and services, 7.5%These trends do not include adjustments to base rates for previous rate increases that were insufficient to cover claims and operating expenses for some plan options.Health care costs for each of those benefit components take into account the compounding effects of both the price of the goods or services provided as well as the quantity of the goods and services consumed.The impact that each trend has to the overall cost of coverage is related to proportionate size of the benefit component. For example, overall spending would rise faster as a result of a 5% increase in professional services versus a 5% increase in drug costs because professional services represents a larger share of medical benefit spending.III. NEW YORK TAXES AND ASSESSMENTSInsurance taxes are built into the costs of health coverage. New Yorkers who voluntarily purchase private health insurance coverage paid more than $4 billion in state health taxes in 2011, according to an analysis by the New York State Conference of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans.New York&rsquo;s Health Care Reform Act of 1996 (HCRA) created two surcharges on health insurance and an additional tax is imposed under Section 206 (formerly Section 332) of the state Insurance Law.The covered lives assessment is an annual flat surcharge or tax on every person who has insurance coverage in the state. Health plans are assessed on the basis of the number of people they cover with individual and family rates that vary depending on the residence of the insured. Among upstate regions defined by the state, the annual covered lives assessment rates in 2014 that impact Excellus Health Plan members are as follows:Per Certificate Per Year by region (Individual : Family)Western: $39.40: $130.03Rochester: $105.72: $348.87Central: $55.59: $183.46Utica-Watertown: $8.54: $28.17Northeastern: $39.94: $131.79The second surcharge created by the 1996 Health Care Reform Act is collected from health plans in the form of a sales tax on many hospital-related services. The surcharge is applied to both self-insured and fully insured plans. Beginning at 8.18% in 1997, the surcharge is now at 9.63%.The third levy, the Section 206 assessment, was originally established to finance New York State Department of Insurance operations but its funding purposes have expanded beyond that purpose. The assessments apply to all licensed insurers in the state (e.g. life, property and casualty, and health), and are based on New York premiums.In total, the above New York taxes and assessments including Section 206 aggregated to nearly 6% of the 2015 small group and individual qualified health plans&rsquo; premium.IV. FEDERAL TAXES, MANDATES AND ADJUSTMENTSAnnual fee on health insurance providers:Beginning in 2014, this fee is based on each health insurance company&rsquo;s market share of net premiums written, adjusted for size and corporate structure.The federal law requires the total fee on nationwide health insurance providers to be collected is:$8 billion in 2014,$11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016,$13.9 billion in 2017, and$14.3 billion in 2018.After 2018, the fee is expected to collect $14.3 billion, indexed to the rate of growth in premiums.Each year, the calculation will be based on the market share of each assessed plan and will change based on the number of companies in the insured market. Under this fee provision, a health plan could incur financial losses but would still be subject to the market share fee.For EHP, this fee increase represents a 1.2% increase to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans for 2015.Risk Adjustment Program:The risk adjustment program is a permanent provision that applies to both the individual and small group insurance market. This federal program assesses a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and uses the revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members.A fee of $0.96 per member per year is collected to fund the risk adjustment program. For EHP, this program reduces small group qualified health plans&rsquo; premiums by about 1.5%. For 2015, this program has no impact on the premium of individual direct pay qualified health plans.Transitional reinsurance program for the individual market:The federal law created a temporary reinsurance program that is to collect nationwide:$10 billion in 2014,$6 billion in 2015, and$4 billion in 2016.Additionally, a separate contribution is to be deposited into the U.S. Treasury that will total $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016.The contribution rate is to be based on a $44 national per capita yearly amount in 2015. All insurers and self- insured group health plans are required to contribute on behalf of all group health plans and health insurance coverage they provide. For EHP, this fee represents about 1% of premium but it is about 40% less than last year resulting in a 0.5% decrease to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans in 2015.For the individual qualified health plans, the federal government established reinsurance for excessive claims. The amount of money being distributed in 2014 is being reduced in 2015. At the same time, this reduction will require a 3.8% premium increase for individual qualified health plans.Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) fee:The federal law created the PCORI to help stakeholders make informed health decisions by advancing the quality and relevance of evidence-based medicine through the use of comparative clinical effectiveness research findings. The fee is set at $2 per year multiplied by the average number of lives covered under the plan for plan years ending before October 1, 2014. And, for plan years ending on or after October 1, 2014, the fee increases based on the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures.Federal mental health mandateThe federal requirements for coverage of mental health parity require a 0.2% increase to current premium to pay for required benefits in 2015.V. OPERATING EXPENSE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTSA portion of what is reported to the state as administrative expenses is attributed to what Federal Health Reform considers quality improvement expenses, meaning the federal government recognizes that these represent costs that lead to overall improvements in health care versus simply a routine business expense, and as a result will be considered a medical benefit expense for purposes of federal MLR calculations.Those quality improvement expenses include such items as:-Improvements in health outcomes brought about by case management and disease management programs,-Actions taken to help prevent hospital readmissions through such things as discharge planning and counseling,-Wellness and community health promotional activities, and-Health information technology that is used to help measure clinical effectiveness and predictive modeling.The proposed rates will more accurately reflect the true operating expense of administering the federal Health Care Reform legislation through the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange. The changes in the health insurance market required building and implementing an entirely new sales channel from what had primarily been a business-to-business marketplace.This required:-The implementation of a new sales call center that saw extended open enrollment deadlines in 2014,-The hiring of additional staff,-Increased direct-to-consumer communication costs to educate consumers about new products and how to access those products, and-The building and implementation of new products, new infrastructure for the continued improvements and changes to the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange and for the implementation of additional mandates for the federal Health Care Reform.Operating expenses - including quality improvement initiatives but excluding federal and state taxes, fees and assessments, and broker commissions - represent 8.7% of premium in small group qualified health plans and 8.4% in individual qualified health plans.VI. REGULATION 146Regulation 146 was a market stabilization mechanism for the individual and small group pools that was in effect prior to the adoption of the ACA. Similar to the ACA Risk Adjustment program, Reg. 146 attempted to equalize the risk within the small group and individual markets by assessing a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and used this revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members. Because of the redundancy with the new risk adjustment program, Reg. 146 is being phased out. The Department of Financial Services is requiring plans to distribute all outstanding compensations through premium adjustments in 2015 and 2016. This distribution plan results in a reduction in the small group qualified health plan premium of 0.3% and in individual premium of about 1%.",Review Complete,12.20,78124NY098,Excellus PPO Copay,"Excellus Health Plan, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Quarterly,16.13,16.13,RC

For 2015, this program has no impact on the premium of individual direct pay qualified health plans.Transitional reinsurance program for the individual market:The federal law created a temporary reinsurance program that is to collect nationwide:$10 billion in 2014,$6 billion in 2015, and$4 billion in 2016.Additionally, a separate contribution is to be deposited into the U.S. Treasury that will total $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016.The contribution rate is to be based on a $44 national per capita yearly amount in 2015. All insurers and self- insured group health plans are required to contribute on behalf of all group health plans and health insurance coverage they provide. For EHP, this fee represents about 1% of premium but it is about 40% less than last year resulting in a 0.5% decrease to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans in 2015.For the individual qualified health plans, the federal government established reinsurance for excessive claims. The amount of money being distributed in 2014 is being reduced in 2015. At the same time, this reduction will require a 3.8% premium increase for individual qualified health plans.Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) fee:The federal law created the PCORI to help stakeholders make informed health decisions by advancing the quality and relevance of evidence-based medicine through the use of comparative clinical effectiveness research findings. The fee is set at $2 per year multiplied by the average number of lives covered under the plan for plan years ending before October 1, 2014. And, for plan years ending on or after October 1, 2014, the fee increases based on the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures.Federal mental health mandateThe federal requirements for coverage of mental health parity require a 0.2% increase to current premium to pay for required benefits in 2015.V. OPERATING EXPENSE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTSA portion of what is reported to the state as administrative expenses is attributed to what Federal Health Reform considers quality improvement expenses, meaning the federal government recognizes that these represent costs that lead to overall improvements in health care versus simply a routine business expense, and as a result will be considered a medical benefit expense for purposes of federal MLR calculations.Those quality improvement expenses include such items as:-Improvements in health outcomes brought about by case management and disease management programs,-Actions taken to help prevent hospital readmissions through such things as discharge planning and counseling,-Wellness and community health promotional activities, and-Health information technology that is used to help measure clinical effectiveness and predictive modeling.The proposed rates will more accurately reflect the true operating expense of administering the federal Health Care Reform legislation through the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange. The changes in the health insurance market required building and implementing an entirely new sales channel from what had primarily been a business-to-business marketplace.This required:-The implementation of a new sales call center that saw extended open enrollment deadlines in 2014,-The hiring of additional staff,-Increased direct-to-consumer communication costs to educate consumers about new products and how to access those products, and-The building and implementation of new products, new infrastructure for the continued improvements and changes to the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange and for the implementation of additional mandates for the federal Health Care Reform.Operating expenses - including quality improvement initiatives but excluding federal and state taxes, fees and assessments, and broker commissions - represent 8.7% of premium in small group qualified health plans and 8.4% in individual qualified health plans.VI. REGULATION 146Regulation 146 was a market stabilization mechanism for the individual and small group pools that was in effect prior to the adoption of the ACA. Similar to the ACA Risk Adjustment program, Reg. 146 attempted to equalize the risk within the small group and individual markets by assessing a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and used this revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members. Because of the redundancy with the new risk adjustment program, Reg. 146 is being phased out. The Department of Financial Services is requiring plans to distribute all outstanding compensations through premium adjustments in 2015 and 2016. This distribution plan results in a reduction in the small group qualified health plan premium of 0.3% and in individual premium of about 1%.",Review Complete,12.20,78124NY102,Univera PPO Copay,"Excellus Health Plan, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Quarterly,16.06,16.06,RC

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 12.22%.Who is affected?The new rates will apply to policies that start from January 2015 through December 2015.  Approximately 23,300 members are enrolled in Small Group plans in Virginia.What are the major factors driving the rate level?Medical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase.  We expect medical costs to go up around 9%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below.  Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.In addition to increasing medical costs, we are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements.  On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes increased expected medical costs by an average of 3.0%.   We have also updated our assumptions around the Affordable Care Act (ACA) required taxes and fees.How will premiums change?Some premiums will increase and others will even go down.  The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling employees, and where in Virginia the group is located.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care.  These actions include:&bull;	Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull;	Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access My Online Services, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services. Additionally, Aetna&rsquo;s Plan for Your Health website aims to educate all consumers, not just Coventry and Aetna members, on how to take advantage of their health care benefits.",Review Complete,12.22,99663VA015,Small Group POS,"Coventry Health Care of Virginia, Inc",VIRGINIA,VA,Annual,12.22,12.22,RC

The rate increase is requested in part to reflect negative financial experience under other non-grandfathered small group business in Indiana (which is used as the base experience in the rate development) with medical expenditures higher than expected.&bull;	Changes in Medical Service Costs:  The increase was mainly driven by the expectation for future medical services costs.  US Health base claims costs increased, with high increases on hospital and pharmacy costs offset somewhat by lower increases on professional claims.  Early 2014 experience has shown additional increases in medical claim levels.&bull;	Changes in Benefits:  The benefits under the plans remain unchanged from the benefits associated with the current rates.  However, as medical costs increase, the share of costs paid by the plan will increase, due to the fixed nature of cost sharing such as deductibles.  We estimate that this contributes approximately 3% to the overall increase requested&ndash; this impact varies across different plan designs.&bull;	Administrative costs and anticipated profits:  The proposed rates include a 1% profit margin.

Scope and Range of the Rate IncreaseCF is proposing to raise premiums by 15.0% on average, prior to age band changes.  The range is 5.4% to 21.0%. For renewing customers, an age band change adds 2.6% to the renewal, on average, with a range of 0.0% to 4.7% for ages 22 and upwards per the CMS age curve.2. Financial Experience of the ProductThe products in this filing were first launched on 1-1-14, and therefore have no experience in the 2013 experience period.  The closed non-grandfathered products from 2013, upon which these rates were based, had total premiums and allowed claims for the incurred period of 1-1-13 through 12-31-13 of $6,355,681 and $7,029,573.The primary factors driving this proposed change in premium rates are:a) Projected significant increase in membership volumes with average morbidities higher than 2014.  CareFirst estimates a morbidity risk factor of 1.35 for 2015.    The morbidity risk factor projections are based upon the model that supported CareFirst&rsquo;s 2014 rate filings.  The model compares known and estimated allowed claims costs per member per month (PMPM) for 2013 to project the costs of various categories of the estimated 2015 membership.b) An aging of the pool of members.  The age of HMO members changed dramatically by increasing 9.3 years, from 27.9 to 37.2.c) An increase in the cost of medical care delivery in the form of claims trend driven by increases in both unit cost and utilization.  See description in section 3.d) An increase in the Health Insurer Fee.  See description in section 4.Our projected DICR for MLR purposes is 83.7%, meeting the 80.0% minimum of Public Health Service Act (PHSA) 218.3. Changes in Medical Service CostsThe proposed trend of 9.0% is a reduction of 200 basis points from 2014&rsquo;s 11.0%.4. Changes in BenefitsAdjustments have been made for pediatric dental, mandatory generics, a new Hepatitis C prescription drug called Sovaldi and maternity.CF is proposing to introduce an incentive program (IP) whereby members can earn medical expense debit cards of as much as $250 annually, for an individual ($650 for a family). The cards must be utilized for qualified medical expenses such as deductibles, copays and out-of-pocket costs. The scope includes all benefit plans within CF&rsquo;s portfolio, On and Off the Exchange. This is being done in a revenue-neutral way.Retail Clinics such as urgent care centers will have reduced copays to match the PCP rather than specialist copay with a negligible price impact.For the Young Adult-Catastrophic plan, the deductible-out-of-pocket maximum has been raised from $6,350 to $6,600.A 5-tiered structure (Generics-Preferred, Generics-Non-Preferred, Brand Name-Preferred, Brand Name-Non-Preferred, Specialty) is currently used for approximately 20% of our benefits. This is changing to a 4-tier structure by collapsing the Generics tiers.Included in this calculation are decreases to claims costs for 1) a change in our Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) in 2014 and 2) a reduction in our fee schedule for out-of-network (OON) utilization for HMO-based products that have an OON option (a.k.a., NP3).5.

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 13.1%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 15 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.For Product 83808MS038 the current enrollment is 15. These members will have an approximate rate increase of 13.1%.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 7.7%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer small employers in Mississippi a variety of plans to choose from. Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&#61623;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&#61623; Changes to required taxes and fees&#61623; Changes to Benefit Requirements&#61623; Restrictions on Underwriting practicesWill Premiums for All Small Group Plans Increase 13.1%?No, the 13.1% is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down, others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, the number of members (for family plans) and their ages, where in Mississippi the employer is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of actions to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.",Review Complete,13.13,83808MS041,SHOP HPN Plat,Coventry Health and Life,MISSISSIPPI,MS,Annual,13.13,13.13,RC

This increase is anticipated to impact approximately 67,000 members. It&rsquo;s important to note that a subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate increase could be higher or lower depending on the benefit plan selected, geographic location, dependent coverage and other factors It should also be noted that we are projecting that our medical loss ratio, as defined by the ACA, for all individual products under the Empire HealthChoice HMO, Inc legal entity will meet the minimum MLR requirement.Financial ExperienceFor 2013 Empire reported a 91.0% ACA-defined medical loss ratio (MLR) for all Individual plans, which exceeded the federal MLR requirement of 82%. Empire was not required to issue rebates as more than 82.0% of the premium dollar was spent on medical care and quality improvement programs, as required by the ACA. In total, Empire expects the rates in the small group pool will yield an ACA-defined medical loss ratio of 88.9% in 2015, significantly above the federal MLR requirement of 82.0%.Changes in Medical CostsThe primary driver of the premium increase is the continued increase in the cost of healthcare. The increases are associated with increases in the&ldquo;unit&rdquo; cost of services primarily from hospitals, physicians and pharmaceutical companies, coupled with increases in the consumption of services, or&ldquo;utilization&rdquo;, by members. Increases in the unit costs of services are driven by many things, including technology advances, cost shifting to private insurers from inadequate Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement, general inflationary pressures, and a variety of other factors. The recent approval and release of a new Hepatitis C drug, which currently costs $1,000 per pill and $84,000 to complete the 84 pill regimen, is an example of these increased cost pressures. Additionally, changes in the utilization of services can be driven by benefit design, economic conditions, and many other factors. Within the projected medical trends, Empire anticipates small increases from higher utilization, while the majority of the increases are associated with higher unit costs. Empire believes its projected medical trends are reasonable, and fall within the range of industry norms.What is Empire doing to keep premiums affordable?Empire is investing in many initiatives to reduce the cost of care, promote wellness and preventive care for our members and communities, as well as working with providers to encourage high-quality, evidence-based care, which costs less over time.We are focusing on patient-centered primary care to ensure coordination of care among all settings, rewarding hospitals and physicians for quality and outcomes such as reducing or eliminating avoidable readmissions, and providing the data that our providers need to assist them in managing a patient&rsquo;s overall condition.We are dedicated to working with our members to find health coverage plans that are the most appropriate, beneficial and affordable for their needs. Also, to help our members manage costs, we continue to negotiate the best possible rates for covered products and provider services, and we are making more tools available to help members better manage health and out-of-pocket costs.As a New York based company that has done business here for over 75 years, we care about our customers and the community. We share the concerns raised by our members over the rising costs of health care services and the corresponding impact they have on premiums, particularly in this challenging economy. At Empire, we are committed to driving quality in the health care system, improving the lives of not only the members we serve, but also the health of communities across New York.",Review Complete,7.37,80519NY018,HMO - Off Exchange,"Empire HealthChoice HMO, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Annual,17.90,17.90,RC

(Coventry HL) has proposed an increase of 11.6%, with  this amount varying across plans from between 0.9% and 18.6%. Rate changes were calculated by comparing current 2014 plans to the most similar 2015 plans. Coventry HL experience was considered fully credible, consequently the rate development is based exclusively on a projection of base period experience under this license. Coventry is also including in this filing a quarterly rate increase of 2.1%, based on an assumed annual trend of 8.6%.In the development of 2015 projected allowed claims Coventry HL assumes a trend level of 8.6% between the base period and the projection period. This is at the high end of what we have observed as pricing trend in the market, but not unreasonable.  The largest adjustment to experience is an 12.8% morbidity adjustment reflecting both an adjustment for the change in market morbidity and an adjustment of pre-ACA Coventry morbidity to market levels. In addition, Coventry applies a 3% adjustment to base period experience to reflect very favorable large claims experience in the base period. Additionally, Coventry HL included an adjustment of 1.4% to take into account benefit changes (the addition of essential health benefits), as well as geographic and network differences. Non-benefit expense loads were reduced in aggregate compared to the equivalent rate filing in 2014, with increases in taxes and fees more than offset by reductions in administrative expenses.The change in premium rates by plan is a consequence of a transition to an updated methodology, driven in part by the acquisition of Coventry by Aetna. The updated pricing models with updated large group claims experience data were used to estimate paid:allowed ratios. Utilization assumptions were also re-assessed, using an internal Aetna model of the impact of benefit design on utilization, calibrated using large group claims experience. This has resulted in utilization estimates changing relative to the HHS parameters used in prior years, with greater experience variation being attributed to benefit design.The issuer expects their Federal Minimum Loss Ratio to be 86%, above the minimum required threshold of 80%.They have provided the calculation and we find it reasonable.Coventry HL has provided sufficient support for their assumptions and rating methodology. The Coventry HL actuary attested that rates have been developed in accordance with Actuarial Standards of practice.

We have a deep understanding of the affordability crisis within the healthcare marketplace and understand the challenge individuals and families have in paying premiums for their coverage. We understand that as a medical insurer we have a role in controlling costs. During the last several years we have reduced our administration and commission expenses significantly. Fundamentally, the vast majority of our rate increases reflect the cost of medical care that we fund on behalf of our policyholders. The following response helps to inform customers and other stakeholders about the company&rsquo;s position.1) How Assurant Health sets rates:Assurant Health is committed to setting premium rates at a level that allows us to continue to serve the needs of our customers. Our premium rates are based on appropriate actuarial practices, backed by decades of experience and expertise in the individual market.  In addition, we worked with independent actuarial consultants to validate our pricing methodology.  We maintain our recent rate filings are actuarially justified and appropriate, and that they will enable Assurant Health to meet the medical loss ratio (MLR) requirements under health care reform.2) Assumption support:We provided substantial support for the assumptions on which the 2015 rate increase is based.  In addition, our Wyoming rate filing was reviewed by an independent actuarial consultant, which found our assumptions supporting such rates to be reasonable.Plans effective on or after January 1, 2014 are guaranteed issue, which means all applicants must be issued coverage regardless of health status, this continues to impact the morbidity of the single risk pool in 2015.  We provided detailed support, including consultant data, outlining the development of our morbidity assumption, which adjusts for the impact of the guaranteed issue environment.Our medical trend assumption is supported by historical data and is based on the historical average claims trend of our customers. Assurant Health uses medical trend data that factors in both the rising cost of health care and the utilization of medical services and prescription drugs by our customers in determining premium rates.","This is a Time Insurance Company rate filing for our existing individual medical products.These are non-grandfathered Individual Major Medical products which cover the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) as required under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

This includes increases in both the price and utilization of medical services.  In addition, there are new fees associated with the ACA which contributed to the rate increase. The increase is also caused by a decrease in reinsurance recoveries provided by the ACA reinsurance program. The guarantee issue environment also results in increased costs as there continues to be migration from other market segments.The loss ratio is the ratio of incurred claims to earned premium.

Lower cost small groups are expected to remain outside the ACA single-risk pool due to more favorable premium rates afforded to them in the pre-ACA rating formula.

In this filing, the company included appropriate rate justifications to demonstrate their rate changes were not unreasonable given the company assumptions about the future, and the experience and enrollment data available to the company at the time of the filing.",Not Applicable,"SummaryCoventry is filing rates for Individual HMO plans in Florida. This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 14.1%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 246,021 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 10.7%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For policies issued to individuals in Florida, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&middot; The cost for an inpatient hospital admission has increased 10.2%.&middot; Costs for pharmacy prescriptions have gone up 9.8%.&middot; The average cost for outpatient has increased 9.5%.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer individuals in Florida a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes increased expected medical costs by an average of 0.61%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&middot;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&middot; Enhanced network access standards&ndash; which limit our ability to control the cost and quality of medical care&middot; Changes to required taxes and fees&middot; Phase-out of the Transtional Reinsurance Program which increases rates for plans issued to individualsWill Premiums for All Individual Increase 14.1%?No, the 14.1% is an average. Rate changes differ by product due to the impact of benefit changes. These average increases are:&middot; 14.2% for the Coventry Carelink Exchange HMO product&middot; 12.5% for the Coventry Carelink HMO product&middot; 10.5% for the Coventry HMO productIn addition, some premiums will increase by less or more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the subscriber chooses, when the subscriber&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling members, where in Florida the subscriber is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Individual business.  Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&middot; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&middot; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access My Online Services, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services.

The remaining 1,910 enrolled directly with Premera.Plan design and benefitsThese plans are designed to meet the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirements for actuarial value and Essential Health Benefits.  For 2015 we have added in network pediatric dental class 1 services to be covered in full on our gold plans.Rates and changes in costsWe are extremely concerned about the costs we are currently seeing in the Alaska market and the implications of these costs for the long term sustainability of individual healthcare coverage across the state.The implementation of the ACA has transformed the Alaska individual market. The combination of guaranteed access to coverage, the extension of non ACA compliant plans under transitional relief rules and a state with a comparatively small number of individual consumers may not be sustainable as currently structured.  Although the ACA includes some risk mitigation programs (reinsurance, risk adjustment and risk corridors) these are insufficient in a state that lacks an individual market which is large or stable enough to spread risk.The risk experience in the metallic plan risk pool is further influenced by the fact that 50 percent of the state&rsquo;s high risk pool (ACHIA) and 100 percent of the federal Preexisting Condition Insurance Pool have left those plans and have likely now purchased coverage in the individual market.  Premera may have obtained a disproportionate share of these individuals.Premera is committed to working with the Division of Insurance (DOI), the State, and the industry to develop and implement programs that will help to stabilize the market and keep costs affordable for individual consumers.   As a result, our 2015 rate filing is significantly lower than is needed to break even for our metallic lines of business. Programs such as a supplemental state re insurance program will spread high medical costs across the insured market and limit the need for large rate increases in the individual market in the future.For 2015 a 72.3 percent would be required for this line of business to break even. However, Premera is filing for an average rate increase of 37.2 percent across our individual metallic plans both on and off the exchange.  Based on this filing, rate increases could range from 35.2 percent to 40.2 percent.Key drivers of ratesThese rates are driven by two key factors:The extremely high claims costs that are being incurred by members on our metallic plans.The size and composition of the pool across which these claims costs are being spread.Claims costsBased on data from the first quarter of 2014, our claims costs per member, per month are running at $878, well over the $195 we spent per member, per month in 2013Just 15 new members have incurred $3.8 million between January 1st and April 30th in 2014.Pool size and compositionPrior to open enrollment we had anticipated that approximately 15,000 consumers would enroll in metallic plans. However, most likely as a result of problems with Healthcare.gov and the extension of nonmetallic plans under transitional relief, only 6,000 consumers enrolled.The demographic composition of those that did enroll in metallic plans was older and less healthy than anticipated.Just to break even, given the claims experience we are currently seeing, would require a 72.3 percent rate increase for our individual metallic plans for 2015. This rate increase breaks down as detailed below:Health condition of new enrollees, including from state and federal high risk pools: 56.68 percentReduction of federal re insurance: 7.8 percentIncrease in federal tax on insured health plans: 2.2 percentRemaining factors: 6.2 percent, specifically,4.7 percent for overall rising medical costs1.5 percent for additional fees and administrative costsWe do not want to pass on such a significant rate increase to our individual market consumers in Alaska.  As such we are filing for a 37.2 percent average rate increase for 2015, which includes a projected loss of $5 million for Premera.Expected use of the rate dollarPremera is committed to using our members&rsquo; rate dollar responsibly and consistently pays out a high percentage of the members&rsquo; rate dollar on medical claims. Given the current claims experience for this line of business and our projected losses in 2015, we expect to pay over 100percent of our members&rsquo; premium dollars toward medical claims for 2015, thus incurring a loss on this line of business. In addition to medical claims, the following costs will also be incurred:ACA related taxes and fees, including fees paid toward Healthcare.gov, account for 6.9percent of the rate dollar in 2015.Premera continues to focus on increasing efficiency and reducing our administrative expenses. These costs are expected to account for 6percent of the rate dollar in 2015.Commission to producers brokers is expected to account for 3percent of members&rsquo; premium dollar in 2015Financial experience of the product:2014 is the first year of experience for these products. Based on data through April 2014, Premera currently projects a $3.6 million loss serving individual market customers on metallic plans in 2014 without commercial reinsurance.Our estimates show that without a rate increase for 2015, these losses could increase to $37 million in 2015, based on a market of 12,000 members.

The requested rate increase was projected to be significantly less than needed in order to cover the projected cost of claims and expenses in Alaska in 2015 and in determining whether the requested rate increase was in compliance with federal and state rating laws, the Division did consider Premera&rsquo;s financial stability and strength to assure that it was sufficient to make good on its obligation to pay claims.Premera projects that their loss ratio for the individual insurance business will significantly exceed the federal minimum loss ratio of 80 percent and therefore anticipates no rebates will be paid.The rate changes will become effective on 1/1/2015.",Not Applicable,"Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield HHS Form Part IIProduct effective date January 1st 2015Individual Metallic ProductsPremera Blue Cross Blue Shield (Premera) is filing this rate change request to cover the annual cost increases which apply to our individual metallic products both in and out of the exchange in Alaska.Members affected by this filingPremera currently has 6,923 members on metallic plans. 5,013 of those members enrolled through the Healthcare.gov, the federal marketplace. The remaining 1,910 enrolled directly with Premera.Plan design and benefitsThese plans are designed to meet the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirements for actuarial value and Essential Health Benefits.  For 2015 we have added in network pediatric dental class 1 services to be covered in full on our gold plans.Rates and changes in costsWe are extremely concerned about the costs we are currently seeing in the Alaska market and the implications of these costs for the long term sustainability of individual healthcare coverage across the state.The implementation of the ACA has transformed the Alaska individual market. The combination of guaranteed access to coverage, the extension of non ACA compliant plans under transitional relief rules and a state with a comparatively small number of individual consumers may not be sustainable as currently structured.  Although the ACA includes some risk mitigation programs (reinsurance, risk adjustment and risk corridors) these are insufficient in a state that lacks an individual market which is large or stable enough to spread risk.The risk experience in the metallic plan risk pool is further influenced by the fact that 50 percent of the state&rsquo;s high risk pool (ACHIA) and 100 percent of the federal Preexisting Condition Insurance Pool have left those plans and have likely now purchased coverage in the individual market.  Premera may have obtained a disproportionate share of these individuals.Premera is committed to working with the Division of Insurance (DOI), the State, and the industry to develop and implement programs that will help to stabilize the market and keep costs affordable for individual consumers.   As a result, our 2015 rate filing is significantly lower than is needed to break even for our metallic lines of business. Programs such as a supplemental state re insurance program will spread high medical costs across the insured market and limit the need for large rate increases in the individual market in the future.For 2015 a 72.3 percent would be required for this line of business to break even. However, Premera is filing for an average rate increase of 37.2 percent across our individual metallic plans both on and off the exchange.  Based on this filing, rate increases could range from 35.2 percent to 40.2 percent.Key drivers of ratesThese rates are driven by two key factors:The extremely high claims costs that are being incurred by members on our metallic plans.The size and composition of the pool across which these claims costs are being spread.Claims costsBased on data from the first quarter of 2014, our claims costs per member, per month are running at $878, well over the $195 we spent per member, per month in 2013Just 15 new members have incurred $3.8 million between January 1st and April 30th in 2014.Pool size and compositionPrior to open enrollment we had anticipated that approximately 15,000 consumers would enroll in metallic plans. However, most likely as a result of problems with Healthcare.gov and the extension of nonmetallic plans under transitional relief, only 6,000 consumers enrolled.The demographic composition of those that did enroll in metallic plans was older and less healthy than anticipated.Just to break even, given the claims experience we are currently seeing, would require a 72.3 percent rate increase for our individual metallic plans for 2015. This rate increase breaks down as detailed below:Health condition of new enrollees, including from state and federal high risk pools: 56.68 percentReduction of federal re insurance: 7.8 percentIncrease in federal tax on insured health plans: 2.2 percentRemaining factors: 6.2 percent, specifically,4.7 percent for overall rising medical costs1.5 percent for additional fees and administrative costsWe do not want to pass on such a significant rate increase to our individual market consumers in Alaska.  As such we are filing for a 37.2 percent average rate increase for 2015, which includes a projected loss of $5 million for Premera.Expected use of the rate dollarPremera is committed to using our members&rsquo; rate dollar responsibly and consistently pays out a high percentage of the members&rsquo; rate dollar on medical claims. Given the current claims experience for this line of business and our projected losses in 2015, we expect to pay over 100percent of our members&rsquo; premium dollars toward medical claims for 2015, thus incurring a loss on this line of business. In addition to medical claims, the following costs will also be incurred:ACA related taxes and fees, including fees paid toward Healthcare.gov, account for 6.9percent of the rate dollar in 2015.Premera continues to focus on increasing efficiency and reducing our administrative expenses. These costs are expected to account for 6percent of the rate dollar in 2015.Commission to producers brokers is expected to account for 3percent of members&rsquo; premium dollar in 2015Financial experience of the product:2014 is the first year of experience for these products. Based on data through April 2014, Premera currently projects a $3.6 million loss serving individual market customers on metallic plans in 2014 without commercial reinsurance.Our estimates show that without a rate increase for 2015, these losses could increase to $37 million in 2015, based on a market of 12,000 members. This equates to a loss of approximately $250 per member, per month.",Review Complete,36.94,38344AK061,Multi-State Plan Select HSA,Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska,ALASKA,AK,Annual,36.94,36.94,RC

(PHP)Consumer Disclosure for Proposed Health Insurance Rate IncreaseIndividual Non-Grandfathered FormsRate Change Effective January 1, 2015PHP proposes to increase its Individual Non-Grandfathered premium rates in Indiana by an average of 12.9 percent, effective January 1, 2015. The increase is attributable to normal annual upward trends in average medical costs plus adjustments to reflect somewhat poorer average health of the expected covered population than was anticipated in pricing of 2014 premiums. The rate increase is expected to impact approximately 11,000 members renewing coverage under contracts compliant with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and renewing on January 1, 2015. A subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate increase may be higher or lower depending on the benefit plan selected, geographic location, age characteristics, and dependent coverage.Financial Experience - PHP&rsquo;s individual health insurance products that are the subject of this rate increase filing were newly introduced effective January 1, 2014 to comply with very significant 2014 individual market reforms implemented under the ACA. As such, very little financial experience is yet available under the new products. PHP expects the proposed rate increase to cover projected medical trends and other cost impacts and to yield a 2015 medical loss ratio of 80.7 percent on an ACA basis, meaning more than eighty cents of each premium dollar is expected to go toward covering medical expenses.Changes in Medical Costs - Primary drivers of premium increases are associated with increases in the unit costs of health care services as well as changes in consumption (utilization) of those services. Unit cost increases are driven by technology advances in medical treatments, equipment and newly developed drugs, changes in negotiated provider network arrangements, cost-shifting to private insurers from Medicare and Medicaid, regulatory changes, and various other factors. Consumption changes arise from changes in the average health risks of the population covered, population aging, general improvement or deterioration in lifestyle health habits of the population covered, evolutionary changes in medical practice patterns, variations in benefit plan design that may encourage or discourage usage of medical services, and many other factors.Changes in Benefits - The ACA requires coverage of a defined set of&ldquo;essential health benefits&rdquo; (EHB). Elements of EHB, such as required preventive services, change over time as new pronouncements are received from regulatory authorities and contribute to the need for rate increases.Administrative Costs and Anticipated Margins - PHP continues to effectively manage and reduce its administrative and selling costs. This category is also affected by taxes and fees that are imposed under the ACA.  Administrative costs and anticipated margins are not expected to materially change such that the changes would impact the proposed rate increase. The ACA requires that no less than 80 percent of premium dollars go toward medical expenses - otherwise a premium rebate to individual subscribers must be generated to refund the difference. PHP anticipates that the proposed rate increase will fit within the ACA requirement and not result in rebates owed to subscribers.",Review Complete,12.90,50816IN020,Indigo Individual HMO Plans_No Pediatric Dental,"Physicians Health Plan of Northern Indiana, Inc.",INDIANA,IN,Annual,12.77,12.77,RC

This rate increase is proposed for all FHCP PPACA compliant plans.  The proposed rate increase is due to the following reasons.Market Risk-The experience of the FHCP Individual PPACA plans is more adverse than assumed in the current 2014 rates.  For example, the Transitional Policy that was announced by the Administration, first articulated in November 2013, and subsequently extended in March 2014, is projected to result in a more adverse population than assumed in the current rates because previously medically underwritten non-grandfathered members are allowed to remain in transitional plans.Medical Inflation, Trend, Combined effect of medical provider price increases, utilization changes, medical cost shifting, and new medical procedures and technology.Reinsurance Credit-Reduction in reinsurance coinsurance from 2014 to 2015.Addition of coverage for Essential Health Benefits i.e. Breast Pump expanded coverage, Oral Chemo Parity.An adjustment for additional prescription drugs that were added to the formulary, i.e. Solvadi and Olysio.Increase in Insurer Fee, PCORI, Exchange Fee, as a result of assumed increase in the proportion of on exchange revenue based on 2014 experience.Financial experience of the product. FHCP has only sold PPACA compliant plans in 2014.  FHCP does not have credible financial experience for these PPACA compliant plans.Changes in Medical Service Costs. FHCP medical costs have been increasing moderately.  This is in part due to the fact that FHCP is a hybrid of Staff Physicians and contracted FFS Physicians.  Also, FHCP owns and operates our own Pharmacies. Thus, low trend factors were used to project future PPACA plan medical costs.Changes in benefits.  FHCP has 33 Individual Product IDs.  All products have the option of the Gym benefit. FHCP has an HMO and a POS Network.  Plan benefits are generally deductible and coinsurance, with some plans having copays on professional services.  Pediatric Dental will no longer be included as an optional benefit.  There were some additional Essential Health Benefits that were required in 2015 i.e. Breast Pump expanded coverage, Oral Chemo Coverage, Over-the-Counter Coverage.Administrative costs and anticipated profits. Administrative costs for FHCP&rsquo;s Individual PPACA plans have been moderately higher than expected in 2014.  There are the required Administrative Taxes and Fees, in additional to the increasing PPACA fees.  FHCP profits are projected to be similar to our current Commercial lines of business.

For example, the Transitional Policy that was announced by the Administration, first articulated in November 2013, and subsequently extended in March 2014, is projected to result in a more adverse population than assumed in the current rates because previously medically underwritten non-grandfathered members are allowed to remain in transitional plans.Medical Inflation, Trend, Combined effect of medical provider price increases, utilization changes, medical cost shifting, and new medical procedures and technology.Reinsurance Credit-Reduction in reinsurance coinsurance from 2014 to 2015.Addition of coverage for Essential Health Benefits i.e. Breast Pump expanded coverage, Oral Chemo Parity.An adjustment for additional prescription drugs that were added to the formulary, i.e. Solvadi and Olysio.Increase in Insurer Fee, PCORI, Exchange Fee, as a result of assumed increase in the proportion of on exchange revenue based on 2014 experience.Financial experience of the product. FHCP has only sold PPACA compliant plans in 2014.  FHCP does not have credible financial experience for these PPACA compliant plans.Changes in Medical Service Costs. FHCP medical costs have been increasing moderately.  This is in part due to the fact that FHCP is a hybrid of Staff Physicians and contracted FFS Physicians.  Also, FHCP owns and operates our own Pharmacies. Thus, low trend factors were used to project future PPACA plan medical costs.Changes in benefits.  FHCP has 33 Individual Product IDs.  All products have the option of the Gym benefit. FHCP has an HMO and a POS Network.  Plan benefits are generally deductible and coinsurance, with some plans having copays on professional services.  Pediatric Dental will no longer be included as an optional benefit.  There were some additional Essential Health Benefits that were required in 2015 i.e. Breast Pump expanded coverage, Oral Chemo Coverage, Over-the-Counter Coverage.Administrative costs and anticipated profits. Administrative costs for FHCP&rsquo;s Individual PPACA plans have been moderately higher than expected in 2014.  There are the required Administrative Taxes and Fees, in additional to the increasing PPACA fees.  FHCP profits are projected to be similar to our current Commercial lines of business.  No additional adjustment was made for higher risk.",Review Complete,11.28,56503FL148,Gym Access IND Essential Plus Platinum POS 66,"Florida Health Care Plan, Inc.",FLORIDA,FL,Annual,11.28,11.28,RC

(Bolton Health) to provide independent actuarial reviews of health insurance rate filings submitted to DORA.This disposition letter is prepared for the purpose of documenting the primary pricing components of Humana Insurance Company&rsquo;s (Humana) rate filing numbered Sircon 288398, other uses may be inappropriate.IntroductionThe purpose of Humana&rsquo;s filing (Sircon 288398) is to offer a small group major medical product, covering essential health benefits, into the Colorado market. The plans submitted under this filing are intended to only be sold off of Connect for Health Colorado (the Colorado health exchange).The proposed overall annual rate increase from 1/1/2014 to 1/1/2015 associated with this filing is 12.32% and will range from 12.13% to 12.52% throughout 2015.PlansHumana filed multiple Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) and indemnity plan designs under Sircon 288398.  Table 1 (below) summarizes each of these plan designs.Projected Premiums and Claims ExpenseHumana Insurance Company&rsquo;s calendar year 2013 small group claims data only included claims for approximately 248 lives as of December 31, 2013.  Based on the Colorado credibility requirement stipulated in Colorado regulation 4-2-39, Humana assigned 35% credibility to this experience. In order to achieve a 100% credibility level, Humana combined this data with the Humana Health Plan Inc. small group experience for 2013 which contained approximately 12,000 lives.  This experience is fully credible and meets all Colorado credibility requirements.For the purpose of projecting to 2015, Humana applied the following adjustments to the 2013 allowed claims shown in Table 2, unless specified otherwise, all factors listed below are multiplicative:&bull;	Trend&ndash; Humana applied two years of trend using a factor of 1.122, which translates to an annual allowed trend of 5.83%.  This trend factor was developed based on historical area specific trends from Humana&rsquo;s Small Group Commercial block of business data.&bull;	Morbidity&ndash; Humana applied a 0.813 adjustment factor intended to capture the change in underlying morbidity for the risk pool in 2015 compared to the experience period. Reasons for this change include groups moving to individual coverage, the risk of projected new sales, and the impact from groups moving to an early renewal date.&bull;	Changes in Benefits&ndash; A 1.037 adjustment factor was applied to account for the addition of benefits that must be covered under the EHB package.  These benefits include pediatric dental, pediatric vision, FHM parity, private duty nursing, women&rsquo;s preventive services, orthodontia, chiropractic, prosthetics, lung cancer screenings, and breast cancer drugs.  This adjustment factor also includes anticipated changes in the average utilization of services due to differences in average cost sharing requirements during the experience period and in the projection period.&bull;	Risk Adjustment&ndash; Humana used an adjustment factor to account for the expected transfer amount due to the risk adjustment process. This adjustment factor was derived from Humana&rsquo;s participation in a study by Wakely Consulting.  The projected risk adjustment is $13.64 PMPM and includes the Risk Adjuster Fee which will be charged at $0.96 PMPY or $0.08 PMPM.&bull;	Reinsurance&ndash; The Reinsurance Assessment Fee will be charge at $44 PMPY or $3.67 PMPM in compliance with the Federal Register&ndash; Vol. 78, No. 231.&bull;	Changes in Demographics&ndash; Humana applied a 1.010 adjustment factor intended to capture the change in age and gender from the experience period to the projection period.  This adjustment is based on historical nationwide age/gender rating factors to calculate the average change in claims.&bull;	Pooling Charge&ndash; Humana applied a 1.054 pooling charge factor.RetentionHumana loaded its rates for a target loss ratio of 80.0%.  The following table (Table 3) summarizes the non-benefit expenses used in the development of Humana&rsquo;s 2015 premiums, values shown in Table 3 are expressed as a percent of premium.Table 3&ndash; Retention ComponentsAdmin Category	                                Percent of PremiumAdministrative Expenses	                        8.50%Commissions	                                        5.40%Premium Taxes	                                0.30%Profit&amp; Contingency Margin	                3.30%Investment Income	                                0.00%Retention to Cover PPACA fees	        2.50%Total Retention	                                20.00%Pricing Loss Ratio (1 - Total Retention)	80.00%As can be seen in Table 3, the retention load includes a marginal 3.30% for profit&amp; contingencies. Furthermore, after removing the retention required to cover ACA fees the target benefit ratio becomes 82.50%, (1.0&ndash; (0.2000&ndash; 0.0250)). Finally, note that Humana&rsquo;s filing includes a demonstration of the Federal Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).This demonstration estimates a federal MLR of 86.30%, which exceeds the federal minimum of 80%.Rating VariablesFinally, consumer monthly premiums are adjusted for age, region, and Actuarial Value Pricing Factors (or plan factors).&bull;	Age&ndash; the Humana age factors comply with the 3:1 maximum variance for ages 21 and above.&bull;	Tobacco Use&ndash; Humana does not rate separately for tobacco use during the effective period.&bull;	Region&ndash; Humana developed regional rating factors based on the nine rating areas set forth by DORA. The regional factors are the same regardless of plan type.&bull;	Plan Factors&ndash; The 2014 plan factors were developed using an internal pricing model with underlying utilization and costs reflective of a standard population equal to that of the anticipated membership in the overall projected risk pool.Public CommentsNo public comments were submitted to the Commissioner related to this filing.ConclusionWe reviewed Humana&rsquo;s filing for compliance with applicable actuarial standards of practice (ASOPs) and state and federal regulations.

For the benefit designsthat cannot be directly coded in the Federal AV calculator, claim distribution information provided in the Federal AV calculator was used to convert the benefit design into equivalent benefit designs that were coded in the Federal AV calculator.Based on our analysis this plan is in compliance with ACA rating requirements.b) Development of Base Period ExperienceRocky Mountain HMO has credible small group experience. The non-grandfathered experience from Rocky Mountain HMO product experience has been utilized for the development of the base rate.The experience period used for the projection is 1/1/2013 to 12/31/2013 paid through 4/30/2014 and is 100 percent credible. The experience period used in the projection includes 122,334 member months.We verified that the base period experience includes an estimate of IBNR based on historical claim lag averages to project future claims payments.c) Development of Trends1) Utilization Adjustment Trend Development and Application:The average annual increase in utilization is 2.2 percent, with a minimum of no trend for capitation utilization and a high of 3.5 percent increase in prescription drug service category.2) Unit Cost Adjustment Trend Development and Application:The average annual increase in unit cost is 3.8 percent, with a low of no increase in capitation utilization and a high of a 13.1 percent increase in prescription drug service category.3) Population Morbidity Adjustment Trend Development and Application:The single risk pool that will be insured is expected to be a much higher risk than the current insured population due to segmentation and selection resulting from transitional plan renewals offered in Colorado. The estimated impact is a 1 percent increase in morbidity in Colorado.4) Other Trend Development and Application:Costs were reviewed and trends were analyzed over the four year time period ending December 31, 2013.  Trend was normalized for age, geographic area, plan design, mix of business, and other factors. The plan sponsor is including a new drug Solvadi (Hepatitis C drug). Inclusion of Solvadi increases the pharmacy costs by 4.5 percent.Based on the historical analysis the proposed trend for the filing is 8.1 percent. This trend is comprised of a Medical total trend of 6.9 percent, including 2.3 percent for utilization and 3 percent for provider cost increase. The trend is also comprised of a Pharmaceutical total trend of 17.11 percent, including increases of 3.5 percent for utilization, 7.15 for provider cost, and 4.5 percent for the introduction of new drugs. In addition to account for the change in the age mix of the population an insurance trend of 1.5 percent was used.The cost and frequency of medical and pharmacy services continue to rise and prompt the need for a rate increase. The proposed trends for projection are within the normal range and are well supported by Rocky Mountain's historical experience.d) Development of Non Benefit ExpensesThe non-benefit expenses used in the projection are 19.5 percent of the premium and include:Commissions of 2.8 percentGeneral Expenses of 10.7 percentProfit and Contingencies of 4.2 percent (pre-tax)PPACA Fees of 3 percentInvestment Income of negative 1.2 percent.Administrative costs for medical benefits were developed at an aggregate level for all plans based on historical administrative cost PMPMs trended to 2015, taking into account any expected changes in costs.It is expected that Rocky Mountain HMO will continue to meet the requirements of the federally defined medical loss ratio.  The expense loading reflects the operating methods of the company and its anticipated expenses in Colorado.e) Development of Profit/Contingencies MarginThe proposed rate for profit and contingencies is 3.0 percent after tax, including investment income. The plan sponsor is including this profit margin to account for the probability of losses due to large claims.f) Development of Projected Loss RatiosTo develop the projected loss ratios, earned premium and incurred claims from the experience period (representing a blend of new and existing business) will be projected forward to the rating period using the trend, non-benefit, and profit assumptions as mentioned above.The premiums will be adjusted for member persistency and for historical experience whereas the claims for these policies will be adjusted using the trend specified in the trend section of this letter.Using the assumptions, the projected loss ratio for the product will be 80.5 percent which is inclusive of the PPACA taxes and fees in the premium.Total retention is estimated to be 19.5 percent with 10.7 percent attributable to general operating expenses, 3 percent attributable to PPACA fees, 2.8 percent for commissions, and 4.2 percent (pre-tax) for profit and contingencies, including investment income.g) How the Rate Increase was DevelopedUsing the experience and the proposed assumptions the medical loss ratio for the group will be 90.2 percent. To achieve the target loss ratio of 80.5 percent Rocky Mountain need a rate increase of 12.02 percent.h) Consumer CommentsThe Division received consumer comments on this filing and considered these comments in its review of the filing, to the extent appropriate. The Division may have had access to confidential information that the consumer did not. We have taken these consumer comments into account during the actuarial review and determined that the material in this filing is documented and justified.i) Reviewer SignoffSigned by:     Nicholas CrifasiBased on the analysis and supporting documentation we recommend approval for the requested rate increase.j) Contractor SignoffSigned by:     Sanjit Puri ASA MAAABased on the analysis and supporting documentation we recommend approval for the requested rate increase.",Not Applicable,"Document:   HIOS Rate Review - Part II of Preliminary JustificationCompany:  Rocky Mountain HealthCare OptionsBlock of Business:   ACA-Compliant Small Group PlansRate Change Effective Date:   January 1, 2015Today's Date:  August 19, 2014Scope and range of the rate increase:The rate change will result in an average increase in premiums of 12.0 percent.

The Cost and Utilization trends for medical were nearly 7 percent and for pharmacy they were over 17 percent.Changes in benefits:Plans that did not contain pediatric dental benefits were discontinued.  All plans offered in 2015 are fully ACA-compliant.

Standard plans offer identical benefits across all insurance companies to allow for easier comparison. All health benefit plans in the individual and small group markets offer comprehensive coverage known as essential health benefits. These benefits may be more extensive than what many individuals and some small businesses purchased in the past. Plan metal levels, such as bronze and silver, show that some plans pay more medical costs than others and make it easier to compare plans. For example, bronze plans are expected to pay about 60 percent of covered medical costs for an average consumer. Some members with high expenses will meet their deductible and out-of-pocket limits, and the plan will pay a larger portion of medical costs. Other members with lower medical costs may not reach those limits, and the plan will pay little or nothing toward their medical costs. ACA compliant plans became available on January 1, 2014. For more information about healthcare reform in Oregon, please visit: http://www.oregon.gov/DCBS/insurance/gethelp/health/Pages/health.aspx.Oregon requires insurance companies offering individual plans to offer one standard bronze and one standard silver plan. There is also a standard gold plan for companies that offer plans in Oregon&rsquo;s health insurance marketplace. Your actual premium may differ based on whether you use tobacco, where you live, your age, and the specific plan you choose. To see a sample of standard bronze, silver, and gold plan premiums throughout the state for a 21-year-old, 40-year-old, or 60-year-old, non-tobacco user, visit www.oregonhealthrates.org. The standard plans are among many plans that will be available to consumers in 2015.Basic Features of this Rate FilingRate Effective Date	Requested Average Annual Change from 1 Year Earlier	Approved Average Annual Change from 1 Year Earlier	2015 Estimated Monthly Premium for Silver Plan, 40-year-old, Portland	Number of Members AffectedOffered Through Cover OregonJanuary 1, 2015	12.5%	10.6%$245	62,965	YesSummary of Rate Filing DecisionThe Department of Consumer&amp; Business Services (DCBS) approved a 10.6 percent average annual rate increase for Moda Health Plan Inc.&rsquo;s ACA-compliant individual health benefit plans instead of the 12.5 percent increase requested.DCBS required Moda to reduce its rate to reflect an anticipated reduction in uncompensated care (sometimes referred to as&ldquo;bad debt&rdquo;) due to the ACA&rsquo;s expansion of coverage and enhanced financial protections. Recent studies have suggested that Oregon has been one of the most successful states in the nation in reducing its overall uninsured rate.The overall effect of these adjustments is an approved rate that is, on average, 10.6 percent higher than one year ago.While the average change in approved rates is a 10.6 percent increase, premium changes will range from an 8.7 percent increase to a 13.7 percent increase. The premium is calculated based on the approved base rate, whether you use tobacco, where you live, your age, and the specific plan you choose.The approved increase is intended to cover the projected rise in health care claims costs.Rating FactorsGuaranteed IssueEvery person is eligible for health insurance, regardless of current or past health status&ndash; this is known as the&ldquo;guaranteed issue&rdquo; requirement. In the past, many high-risk individuals could not buy an individual health plan and instead enrolled in special state-run programs or lacked coverage altogether. The uninsured and high risk pools merged with the rest of the commercial market in 2014, and insurance companies were required to set individual rates based on the average health status of the statewide market. Because insurance companies only have three months of experience with guaranteed issue at the time the filing was made, the exact impact is not yet known, so companies have to estimate how this may affect future claims costs. Because this impact is estimated and every company&rsquo;s current individual business is different, there are a range of possible estimates that may be considered reasonable by DCBS.Moda&rsquo;s estimate of the guaranteed issue requirement was combined with an estimate for the impact of the market merger.  They projected medical costs will increase by 27.9 percent due to these impacts. DCBS determined that Moda&rsquo;s estimate was within a reasonable range.ReinsuranceThere are three programs designed to keep rates stable. One of these programs, reinsurance, pays a portion of large claims in the individual market and is reflected in this filing.DCBS determined that Moda&rsquo;s projection of the reinsurance program was justified and within a reasonable range.Risk CorridorAnother program designed to keep rates stable is risk corridor. Risk corridor is a temporary program that protects against inaccurate rate-setting by sharing gains and losses on claims costs between the federal government and insurers to help ensure stable health insurance premiums.DCBS does not approve rates that are likely to result in receipt of risk corridor payments. With the requested rates, Moda is not projected to share gains or losses from this program so no adjustment was made to Moda&rsquo;s final approved rate as a result of the risk corridor program.Risk AdjustmentThe third program, risk adjustment, is also intended to stabilize the market as newly eligible higher-risk persons buy policies.With the approved rate, Moda is not projected to share gains or losses with this program.Medical CostsOn average, Moda projected medical and prescription costs to increase by 5.5 percent during 2015. Based on information provided by the company and the approved rates, the company is projected to spend at least 80 percent of every premium dollar on claims and quality of care efforts. Insurers are required by federal law to pay a rebate to consumers if the company spends less than 80 percent of premiums on medical claims. DCBS does not approve rates that appear likely to result in rebates.Administrative CostsThe approved rates include the following projected administrative costs:General administrative costs: $29.11 per member per monthTaxes, assessments, and fees: $15.45 per member per monthConsumers often express concern about the impact of an insurer&rsquo;s top management compensation on premiums. For 2013, salaries of Moda&rsquo;s senior executives were 0.3 percent of premiums. This represents approximately $0.96 of a member&rsquo;s average premium each month.Profit/MarginWith the approved rates, Moda projects to make a 1.0 percent profit on this line of business in 2015.Cost Containment and Quality ImprovementModa described several ongoing initiatives to contain costs and improve quality, including:&bull;	Case management and care coordination programs that use evidence-based medicine and best practice clinical care guidelines when prior authorizing inpatient and surgical admissions, durable medical equipment, outpatient therapies, and chiropractic care.&bull;	Length of stay reviews for hospital, inpatient rehabilitation, and skilled nursing facilities.&bull;	Member/patient support to prevent inpatient readmission. The company also provides post-hospitalization care management for members with long-term or complex needs. This includes automatic follow-ups for members with certain identified conditions such as mental health and chemical dependency or congestive heart failure discharges.&bull;	Advanced imaging review, intended to improve patient safety by reducing unnecessary radiation exposure and contain costs. Moda reports this program has resulted in about a 4.0 percent reduction in advanced imaging utilization.________________________________________This Rate Filing Decision Summary is a tool to help explain the rate filing and does not describe all the factors considered as part of the DCBS&rsquo;s rate review.________________________________________DCBS approves health insurance rates in the individual and small group markets. Under Oregon law, DCBS considers actuarial documentation to ensure that rate requests are reasonable in relation to the benefits provided under the policy and that the rate requested is fairly allocated among the ratepayers. In that light, DCBS reviews multiple factors related to proposed rate changes including the insurer&rsquo;s revenues, medical and prescription costs, administrative costs, actual and projected profits, and past rate changes as well as the affect the change will have on Oregon consumers.An insurer cannot increase your rates more than once in a 12-month period. Specific rate changes may vary from this summary, in part because insurers offer different benefit plans.GlossaryAdministrative costs: Expenses the insurance company pays to operate this insurance plan. This includes all expenses not directly related to the cost of claims, such as, but not limited to, salaries of company employees, the cost of the company&rsquo;s offices and equipment, commissions to agents to sell and service policies, and taxes.Medical and prescription costs: The portion of the premium that pays for medical services and prescriptions.Profit: The amount of money remaining after claims and administrative expenses are paid.

This document provides an overview of that filing.Scope and Range of the Rate Increase:The average rate increase for the&ldquo;Blue&amp; U First&rdquo; family of products is approximately 13 percent.  The actual increase experienced by an individual currently enrolled will vary based upon the plan metal level chosen by the individual, as well as the individual&rsquo;s financial situation and the subsidy level set by the exchange. BCBSKC does not have control over the last two items. Approximate rate increases by plan metal level are below:1. Blue&amp; U First PCB and Select&ndash; Platinum:    Not offered in 20152. Blue&amp; U First PCB and Select&ndash; Gold:	Not offered in 20153. Blue&amp; U First PCB and Select&ndash; Silver:	15.1 percent increase4. Blue&amp; U First PCB and Select&ndash; Bronze:	9.9 percent increaseThe above changes will impact 8,050 individuals in Missouri. There have been no other changes to the rating structure relative to 2014.Key Drivers for this Filing:The rate increase for 2015 is attributable to three main factors:1. Increase in medical cost (includes price, utilization, and morbidity)2. Change in the ACA reinsurance program3. Benefit changes1. Increase in Medical Cost:Medical cost has increased significantly in the individual market under ACA. This was expected due to adverse-selection (higher risk individuals purchasing insurance at a higher rate than low risk individuals).Below are year over year cost and utilization trends (in percentages) from our Missouri individual block of business (ACA and grandfathered) through 2nd quarter 2014:Benefit Category 	Cost  	UtilizationInpatient		           8.6	50.7Outpatient		 12.2	25.0Professional	         10.6	10.7Ancillary		          -4.7	55.0Pharmacy		 39.4	26.2As can be seen by the table above, the main drivers in healthcare cost going from an underwritten individual market to no underwriting in ACA has led to a significant increase in utilization and high cost drugs. These trends should normalize over time as the risk pool of the individual market improves and individuals become more knowledgeable healthcare consumers.2. Change in the ACA Reinsurance Program:Federal transitional reinsurance program contributions and benefit limits for 2015 have changed from 2014. Specifically, the reinsurance contribution has changed from 63 dollars PMPY (per member per year) to 44 dollars PMPY. Further, the claims threshold upon which reinsurance recoveries are triggered has changed from 45,000 to 70,000 dollars (CMS may leave it at 45,000 for 2015) and the federal coinsurance percentage has changed from 80 to 50 percent. Changes in the benefit levels of the reinsurance recoveries will only impact the individual market, while the changes in the reinsurance contribution levels will impact both the individual and small group markets.Our analysis of the reinsurance change impacted rates by increasing them approximately 5.0 percent relative to 2014.3. Benefit Changes:Due to a change in the 2015 instructions for the Federal Actuarial Value Calculator, plan designs that were compliant with ACA in 2014 were no longer compliant in 2015 for the following plans:1. Blue&amp; U First PCB&ndash; Silver2. Blue&amp; U First Select&ndash; SilverIn order to bring the plans back into compliance for 2015, we were required to make a benefit change. For the plans noted above, BCBSKC changed the deductible and out-of-pocket maximum from 4,750 (for calendar year 2014) to 4,200 (for calendar year 2015). The benefit change increased the benefit richness for the noted plans by approximately 4.7 percent. In order to adhere to sound actuarial principles, we raised rates by approximately 4.7 percent (1.047 x 1.099 equals 1.151, the rate increase under&ldquo;Scope and Range of the Rate Increase&rdquo;).Financial Experience of the Products:With data through August, BCBSKC&rsquo;s Missouri block of ACA business has produced approximately 38 million in premium and 64 million in claims (estimated using completion). This calculates out to be a loss ratio equal to 168 percent, where the loss ratio is equal to completed medical claims divided by premium. A ratio larger than one indicates we are paying more in medical claims than we are receiving in premium. The ratio presented does not include the 3R&rsquo;s of the ACA (i.e. risk adjustment, reinsurance, and risk corridor). These items will significantly improve our loss ratio.As our loss ratio shows, the risk assumed by an insurer in the ACA market is significant. However, we feel it will be best for the individuals in Missouri if we manage the&ldquo;Blue&amp; U First&rdquo; family of products and our ACA block of business from a long term perspective. If there are no significant changes to the ACA in the future, every year the number of individuals in the ACA market will grow, which will improve the average risk of the market. Once the market is large enough and the majority of individuals covered have a history of health insurance, we will reach a&ldquo;steady state.&rdquo; We are currently in a transitional period before the&ldquo;steady state&rdquo; and in order to prevent volatile rate increases every year, we are trying to balance expected cost for 2015 and the expected cost of what the market will look like years down the road. We believe the approximate 13.0 percent rate increased proposed by us for the&ldquo;Blue&amp; U First&rdquo; family of products will meet our needs as an insurer and will help the individuals of Missouri find quality and affordable healthcare.Administrative Costs and Anticipated Profits:BCBSKC is targeting an 85 percent federal loss ratio for our Missouri ACA block of business, which is 5 percent higher than the minimum allowed for the ACA individual market (below 80 percent requires policyholder rebates). With current information from our ACA block of business our operating costs, including ACA fees and commissions, are around 30 percent of premium. We anticipate higher enrollment for 2015 which will help us spread the cost over more of our policyholders and lower our operating cost as a percentage of revenue. However, when considering our operating costs, we do expect an operating loss for our 2015 ACA block of business. We are willing to take a loss because we believe it is important to the individuals of Missouri to have access to quality and affordable healthcare. In addition, we see it as an investment into the future of healthcare where ACA is likely to be the fastest growing segment for years to come.",Review Complete,13.38,34762MO014,Blue&U First PCB,Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City,MISSOURI,MO,Annual,13.38,13.38,RC

To assist the Commissioner in making these decisions, Maryland Insurance Administration (&ldquo;MIA&rdquo;) actuaries examine the data, methods and assumptions used by each insurer, non-profit health service plan, or HMO (&ldquo;carrier&rdquo;).  They review numerous factors related to proposed premium rates, including the carrier&rsquo;s actual and projected claims experience, medical and prescription costs, administrative costs, and profits or losses.  The Commissioner also considers the impact premium rates will have on Maryland consumers.  Under the federal Affordable Care Act and Maryland law, in the individual and small group markets, 80 cents of every premium dollar must be spent on paying claims or on quality improvement activities that figure increases to 85 cents in the large group market.  If an insurance carrier does not meet these targets, the carrier must pay rebates to policyholders.Modifications to Requested Premium Rates and Basis of ModificationsGroup Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc. submitted a rate filing on May 1, 2014, requesting an average rate increase of 38.1%.  On May 23, 2014, the Company amended its filing to request an average rate increase of 30.2%.  The amended rate filing reflected certain minor adjustments in response to MIA objections, such as modifying its assumptions about projected average age and the projected cost and utilization of dental benefits.  The most significant change, however, was a reduction in the Company&rsquo;s projections about the morbidity of its 2015 individual market enrollees as compared with the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  Specifically, in its amended filing, the Company assigned to its projected 2015 individual market enrollees a morbidity factor that was 1.60 times the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  In its May 1, 2014 filing, the Company had assumed a morbidity factor of 1.75.  The MIA proceeded to review the amended May 23, 2014 filing.The MIA concluded that certain of the Company&rsquo;s data, methods, and assumptions were not well supported, including certain assumptions about the projected morbidity of its individual product enrollees in 2015.  In particular, the Company had not adequately supported its assumptions regarding the number of small group enrollees projected to migrate to its individual products, or its assumptions about the morbidity levels of previously uninsured enrollees.  The MIA further concluded that the Company&rsquo;s actual experience during the first half of 2014, as well as other considerations relating to actual and projected enrollment in the 2014 and 2015 individual market, did not support a 1.60 morbidity factor.  The Commissioner also concluded that the requested average premium rate increase of 30.2% would have an abrupt, substantial, and adverse impact on the approximately 12,714 Marylanders currently enrolled in Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s Affordable Care Act-compliant plans in the individual market, and would introduce a high level of volatility into Maryland&rsquo;s individual health insurance market.The MIA prescribed a morbidity factor of 1.40, rather than the Company&rsquo;s requested morbidity factor of 1.60.  This modification resulted in an approximately 10.6% reduction in the Company&rsquo;s proposed premium rates for 2015.As modified during the rate review process, Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s premium rates for 2015 reflect an approximately 16.2% increase as compared with its premium rates for 2014.&emsp;DeterminationPursuant to&sect; 11-603(c)(2) of the Insurance Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, the Commissioner has determined that the Company&rsquo;s premium rates,  as modified during the rate review process, are not inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.Rate Review Standards and ConsiderationsThe Insurance Commissioner approves health insurance rates in Maryland.

The MIA proceeded to review the amended May 23, 2014 filing.The MIA concluded that certain of the Company&rsquo;s data, methods, and assumptions were not well supported, including certain assumptions about the projected morbidity of its individual product enrollees in 2015.  In particular, the Company had not adequately supported its assumptions regarding the number of small group enrollees projected to migrate to its individual products, or its assumptions about the morbidity levels of previously uninsured enrollees.  The MIA further concluded that the Company&rsquo;s actual experience during the first half of 2014, as well as other considerations relating to actual and projected enrollment in the 2014 and 2015 individual market, did not support a 1.60 morbidity factor.  The Commissioner also concluded that the requested average premium rate increase of 30.2% would have an abrupt, substantial, and adverse impact on the approximately 12,714 Marylanders currently enrolled in Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s Affordable Care Act-compliant plans in the individual market, and would introduce a high level of volatility into Maryland&rsquo;s individual health insurance market.The MIA prescribed a morbidity factor of 1.40, rather than the Company&rsquo;s requested morbidity factor of 1.60.  This modification resulted in an approximately 10.6% reduction in the Company&rsquo;s proposed premium rates for 2015.As modified during the rate review process, Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s premium rates for 2015 reflect an approximately 16.2% increase as compared with its premium rates for 2014.&emsp;DeterminationPursuant to&sect; 11-603(c)(2) of the Insurance Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, the Commissioner has determined that the Company&rsquo;s premium rates,  as modified during the rate review process, are not inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.",Not Applicable,"CAREFIRST BLUECROSS BLUESHIELD (CF) RATE REVIEW REPORTING PART II&ndash; WRITTEN EXPLANATION OF RATE INCREASECareFirst submits this rate filing as directed by MIA Order No. 2014-08-008 (the MIA Order).  The rates set forth in this filing were calculated as directed in the MIA Order, and CareFirst believes that they are inadequate.Accordingly, while the rates in this submission are filed as directed by the MIA Order and based upon the prescribed morbidity factor of 1.40, the information contained in this Actuarial Memorandum reflects a morbidity factor of 1.60.1.	SCOPE AND RANGE OF THE RATE INCREASE: CF is proposing to raise annual premiums by 16.2%, prior to age band changes. (For CFI the proposed renewal is 11.9%.) The range is 13.6% to 20.1%. (For renewing customers, an age band change adds 2.6% to the renewal, on average, with a range of 0.0% to 4.7% for ages 22 and upwards per the CMS age curve.)The primary factors driving this proposed change in premium rates area)	Projected significant increase in membership volumes with average morbidities higher than 2014.b)	Migration in the pool of former enrollees in Maryland&rsquo;s high risk pool the Maryland Health Insurance Plan (MHIP).c)	An aging of the pool of members.d)	An increase in the cost of medical care delivery in the form of claims trend driven by increases in both unit cost and utilization.e)	An increase in the health insurer fee.2.	FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE OF THE PRODUCT: The incurred period is 1-1-13 through 12-31-13. Total premiums and allowed claims for the period were $27,514,930 and $32,329,729, respectively.A.	Changes in the Morbidity of the Population Insured: CareFirst calculated its proposed rates based upon a morbidity factor of 1.60 however, the rates in this filing are calculated based upon a morbidity factor of 1.40 as ordered by the MIA Order.  CareFirst estimates a morbidity risk factor of 1.60 for 2015 as relayed through the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filings (SERFF) on 5-23-14. Our 1.60 factor was computed after consideration for the morbidity risk factor that was included in the 2014 filed and approved rates.  The morbidity risk factor projections are based upon the model that supported CareFirst&rsquo;s 2014 rate filings.  The model compares known and estimated allowed claims costs per member per month (pmpm) for 2013 to project the cost of various categories of the estimated 2015 membership.  These categories are based upon the prior status of the 2015 membership&ndash; previous CareFirst members (medically underwritten under 65 Individuals, MHIP, Group) and New Entrants sorted by income (less than 200% FPL, greater than 200% FPL).  The risk factor for each category is expressed in terms of allowed claims pmpm cost, and is calculated by comparing the category pmpm claims cost to the 2013 CareFirst Individual membership pmpm cost.  More than 50% of the projected 2015 membership is included in categories supported by actual claims data supporting the previous CareFirst member categories.  The New Entrants&rsquo; categories use projected risk scores based upon a Hilltop study (Basic Health Plan) for the members less than 200% FPL and the Group factor for the greater than 200% FPL members. The Group factor is based upon the almost 250 thousand CareFirst Small Group members that have for decades been community rated and guaranteed issue as is now required under ACA for Individual enrollees. CareFirst&rsquo;s judgment is that this extremely large community rated, guaranteed issue small group pool of members is most representative of the New Entrants greater than 200% FPL.B.	Changes in Demographics: Comparing the overall CareFirst member-level average age as of        12-31-12 to 3-31-14, the average age has increased by 4.5 years from 34.0 to 38.5. Age factors will account for a portion of the corresponding increase in claims cost. We find the CMS age curve spread of 3 to 1 to be lower than the 4.5 to 1 that is more correlated with expected claims costs. We have therefore adjusted expected claims costs accordingly in the experience period (EP) index rate projection in the other category.C.	Trend Factors (Cost-Utilization): The proposed trend of 6.5% is a reduction of 270 basis points from 2014&rsquo;s 9.2%. The improvement is concentrated in outpatient hospital and prescription drug services which comprise 37% of total allowed claims.D.	Projected Loss Ratio: Our projected NAIC DICR for MLR purposes is 83.5%, above the 80.0% minimum of Public Health Service Act (PHSA) 218.3.	CHANGES IN MEDICAL SERVICE COSTS: The experience period index rate is a key component driving the renewal. Last year&rsquo;s implicit 2013 index rate was $222 ($203 x trend of 9.2%). The actual for 2013 is $213 for a favorable variance of -4%.4.	CHANGES IN BENEFITS: For CareFirst&rsquo;s Individual offerings in Maryland, our portfolio is not changing. We will still offer 15 benefit plans&ndash; 1 Young Adult-Catastrophic, 4 Bronze, 4 Silver, 4 Gold and 2 Platinum. We have recalculated the costs of&ldquo;Essential Health Benefits&rdquo; (EHB) as well as Non-EHBs.a)	Per COMAR 31.10.39 Utilization Review of Treatment for Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders, Bulletin 14-07 and due to the passage of SB 759-HB 783, Coverage for Autism Spectrum Disorders, we have calculated an increase in claims of $3 per member per month (PMPM) for 2015. This is largely for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) treatments and is a state-mandated EHB benefit. The $3 PMPM is derived from an incidence assumption of 1 in 68 children ages 1-19, an uptake rate of 1 in 3 and an intensity rate of $40,000 to $95,000 per year depending on age.b)	Other adjustments were made for pediatric dental, mandatory generics, a new hepatitis C prescription drug, Sovaldi, and maternity.c)	Other Adjustments: CareFirst (CF) is proposing to introduce an incentive program (IP) whereby members can earn medical expense debit cards of as much as $250 annually, for an individual ($650 for a family). The cards must be utilized for qualified medical expenses such as deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket costs. The scope includes all benefit plans within CF&rsquo;s portfolio, On and Off the Exchange. This is being done in a revenue-neutral way. That is, the cost to CF of the incentive payments was chosen such that they match the expected savings to CF from more efficacious health care delivery. HealthyBlue (HB) was first launched effective 10-1-10 with the objective of motivating and rewarding greater engagement by the member in his or her health, improved wellness and prevention and better provider coordination and quality. As we sought to respond to feedback about HB, subsequent versions were released on 1-1-12 and 10-1-12. This IP represents an evolution of the HB concept. Further, it joins the tenets of HB with our Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) program which was launched on January, 2011.Our aim is that this IP will improve our members&rsquo; health.d)	Included are decreases to claims costs for a change in our Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) in 2014.e)	Membership Projections: We had projected 58% of enrollment in HMO-based plans as of 12-31-14 in our 2014 filings. Actual data as of 4-10-14 indicates that HMO comprises 69% of our CFI members. We had also expected 5% of enrollment in Platinum plans versus actuals of 13%. We incorporated both of these facts in projecting 12-31-15 enrollment.f)	    For the Young Adult-Catastrophic plan, the deductible-out-of-pocket maximum has been raised from $6,350 to $6,600 per year.g)	Also, per HB 0625, oral chemotherapy coverage has been mandated. The cost of reducing cost shares to not exceed those of intravenous chemotherapy has been deemed negligible.h)	Diabetic supplies have been moved to $0 copays. The deductible applies for H.S.A. plans but not for non-H.S.A.s with negligible price impact.i)	    Retail Clinics such as urgent care centers will have reduced copays to match the PCP rather than specialist copay with negligible price impact.j)	    A 5-tiered structure (Generics-Preferred, Generics-Non-Preferred, Brand Name-Preferred, Brand Name-Non-Preferred, Specialty) is currently used for approximately 20% of our benefits. This is changing to 4-tier structure by collapsing the Generics tiers.5.	ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED CONTRIBUTION TO RESERVE: The 2015 desired incurred claims ratio (DICR) is 79.3%.A.	Administrative Expense Load: PMPMs increased by 3% versus 2014.B.	CtR&amp; Risk Margin: Remains at 0.0%, break-even.C.	Taxes and Fees:I.	Community Health Investment of 2.0%.II.

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 19.4%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 13,591 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 8.3%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer individuals in Iowa a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements.  There were changes to our estimates for the relative costs for participating providers.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&bull;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&bull;	Changes to required taxes and fees&bull;	Phase-out of the Transitional Reinsurance Program which increases rates for plans issued to individualsWill Premiums for All Individuals Increase 19.4%?No, the 19.4% is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down, others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the subscriber chooses, the number of members and their ages, where in Iowa the subscriber is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Individual business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&bull;	Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull;	Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Coventry's secure member portal, My Online Services, which was designed to empower our members to become more involved in their health care by allowing them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services.

(NAIC code number 55107) has applied to the Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services to adjust premium rates for its community-rated small group and individual qualified health plans.I. OVERVIEWThe rates being sought contain a zero percent operating margin for the health plan despite the health plan reporting operating losses in 2013 and a forecasted significant operating loss in 2014. The proposed rate adjustment is based on the need to adjust prospectively from the state&rsquo;s reduction of rates by 6.3% on small group qualified health plans and by 4.0% on individual qualified health plans for 2014, an increasing medical cost trend, and changes in the health insurance market driven by federal and state actions. Other contributing factors for the proposed 2015 rate adjustment include increases in fees, taxes and added coverage for new mandated benefits.Excellus Health Plan and related companies (EHP) provide health insurance and administrative services for about 1.8 million upstate New Yorkers in 39 counties. The proposed premium rates affect about 182,000 members or 10% of the health plan&rsquo;s total membership. Its proposed rates are subject to review by the New York Department of Financial Services pursuant to section 4308c of the New York Insurance Law. The Department may approve the proposed rate increase as requested, modify the proposed rate increase, or disapprove the proposed rate increase in its entirety. The determination by the Department shall be supported by sound actuarial assumptions and methods.The rate application will be filed with the Department on or about June 13, 2014. The actual rate increases approved by the Department will be communicated to the impacted parties at least 60 days prior to the date the new rate is implemented for the subscriber. EHP policyholders with renewal dates during 2015 would, if approved, receive the indicated rate adjustments on their next anniversary date on or after January 1, 2015.Excellus Health Plan is required by New York State law to develop rates that assume that at least 82% of premium revenue will be spent on health care costs in the direct pay market along with small groups, be actuarially sound, cover all claim costs, and provide a contribution to ensure adequate reserves. The percent of premium attributable to claims is referred to as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).Excellus Health Plan's MLR has been and continues to exceed the statutory minimums. In 2013, the MLR for Excellus Health Plan was 94.2% for individual direct pay and 91.0% for small groups. Under new reporting requirements for 2014, the three-year cumulative MLR is 94.4% for individual direct pay and 91.5% for small group qualified health plans. With the proposed rate adjustments, Excellus Health Plan's MLRs would remain well above the minimum levels. In the event the MLR falls below the required minimum, the health plan refunds any difference to policyholders.Periodic rate adjustments are necessary to secure the ability of Excellus Health Plan, or any insurer, to produce sufficient revenue and surplus for reserves to assure continued coverage and claim payments both for current health care needs, and potential catastrophic cost situations. Excellus Health Plan's reserves vary from year to year based on actual health care costs incurred. As of Dec. 31, 2013, the health plan had reserves equivalent to 2.5 months of claims and operating expense, and more than the minimum required by New York State law. These reserves are the insurance that assures payment even when costs run higher than anticipated, or emergencies or disasters occur, and should not be used as an alternative fund to temporarily reduce rate adjustments.In filing its rate application, Excellus Health Plan is sensitive to the fact that individuals and small businesses struggle to afford higher premiums. However, it is clear that an increase in premiums is necessary to assure the continued operations of the Plan and the viability of its product offerings. Because EHP already has a high MLR, failure to approve these rates would only lead to the need for even greater rate increases in the future as claim costs would eventually exceed premiums collected.II. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASEEscalating health care costsThe cost of health care services, equipment and products continues to be the primary reason for rate increases.Trend is a very important consideration in determining the need for a premium rate adjustment. Upstate New York is not immune to national trends in health care costs given our state&rsquo;s population and demographics. Industry experts such as Segal Consulting and Buck Consultants are forecasting a 7.2-10.4% medical benefit trend nationwide for 2014. EHP is forecasting an overall medical benefit trend factor for its commercial fully insured business of 6.8% for 2014-2015. The trend forecast takes into account projected increases in costs attributed to what Excellus Health Plan pays out in claims expenses for hospital inpatient and outpatient care, professional services, pharmacy benefits and other goods and services. The health plan&rsquo;s anticipated changes in medical benefit spending are summarized as follows:Hospital inpatient, 6.9%Hospital outpatient, 6.4%Professional services, 4.5%Pharmacy, 10.6%Other medical goods and services, 7.5%These trends do not include adjustments to base rates for previous rate increases that were insufficient to cover claims and operating expenses for some plan options.Health care costs for each of those benefit components take into account the compounding effects of both the price of the goods or services provided as well as the quantity of the goods and services consumed.The impact that each trend has to the overall cost of coverage is related to proportionate size of the benefit component. For example, overall spending would rise faster as a result of a 5% increase in professional services versus a 5% increase in drug costs because professional services represents a larger share of medical benefit spending.III. NEW YORK TAXES AND ASSESSMENTSInsurance taxes are built into the costs of health coverage. New Yorkers who voluntarily purchase private health insurance coverage paid more than $4 billion in state health taxes in 2011, according to an analysis by the New York State Conference of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans.New York&rsquo;s Health Care Reform Act of 1996 (HCRA) created two surcharges on health insurance and an additional tax is imposed under Section 206 (formerly Section 332) of the state Insurance Law.The covered lives assessment is an annual flat surcharge or tax on every person who has insurance coverage in the state. Health plans are assessed on the basis of the number of people they cover with individual and family rates that vary depending on the residence of the insured. Among upstate regions defined by the state, the annual covered lives assessment rates in 2014 that impact Excellus Health Plan members are as follows:Per Certificate Per Year by region (Individual : Family)Western: $39.40: $130.03Rochester: $105.72: $348.87Central: $55.59: $183.46Utica-Watertown: $8.54: $28.17Northeastern: $39.94: $131.79The second surcharge created by the 1996 Health Care Reform Act is collected from health plans in the form of a sales tax on many hospital-related services. The surcharge is applied to both self-insured and fully insured plans. Beginning at 8.18% in 1997, the surcharge is now at 9.63%.The third levy, the Section 206 assessment, was originally established to finance New York State Department of Insurance operations but its funding purposes have expanded beyond that purpose. The assessments apply to all licensed insurers in the state (e.g. life, property and casualty, and health), and are based on New York premiums.In total, the above New York taxes and assessments including Section 206 aggregated to nearly 6% of the 2015 small group and individual qualified health plans&rsquo; premium.IV. FEDERAL TAXES, MANDATES AND ADJUSTMENTSAnnual fee on health insurance providers:Beginning in 2014, this fee is based on each health insurance company&rsquo;s market share of net premiums written, adjusted for size and corporate structure.The federal law requires the total fee on nationwide health insurance providers to be collected is:$8 billion in 2014,$11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016,$13.9 billion in 2017, and$14.3 billion in 2018.After 2018, the fee is expected to collect $14.3 billion, indexed to the rate of growth in premiums.Each year, the calculation will be based on the market share of each assessed plan and will change based on the number of companies in the insured market. Under this fee provision, a health plan could incur financial losses but would still be subject to the market share fee.For EHP, this fee increase represents a 1.2% increase to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans for 2015.Risk Adjustment Program:The risk adjustment program is a permanent provision that applies to both the individual and small group insurance market. This federal program assesses a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and uses the revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members.A fee of $0.96 per member per year is collected to fund the risk adjustment program. For EHP, this program reduces small group qualified health plans&rsquo; premiums by about 1.5%. For 2015, this program has no impact on the premium of individual direct pay qualified health plans.Transitional reinsurance program for the individual market:The federal law created a temporary reinsurance program that is to collect nationwide:$10 billion in 2014,$6 billion in 2015, and$4 billion in 2016.Additionally, a separate contribution is to be deposited into the U.S. Treasury that will total $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016.The contribution rate is to be based on a $44 national per capita yearly amount in 2015. All insurers and self- insured group health plans are required to contribute on behalf of all group health plans and health insurance coverage they provide. For EHP, this fee represents about 1% of premium but it is about 40% less than last year resulting in a 0.5% decrease to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans in 2015.For the individual qualified health plans, the federal government established reinsurance for excessive claims. The amount of money being distributed in 2014 is being reduced in 2015. At the same time, this reduction will require a 3.8% premium increase for individual qualified health plans.Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) fee:The federal law created the PCORI to help stakeholders make informed health decisions by advancing the quality and relevance of evidence-based medicine through the use of comparative clinical effectiveness research findings. The fee is set at $2 per year multiplied by the average number of lives covered under the plan for plan years ending before October 1, 2014. And, for plan years ending on or after October 1, 2014, the fee increases based on the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures.Federal mental health mandateThe federal requirements for coverage of mental health parity require a 0.2% increase to current premium to pay for required benefits in 2015.V. OPERATING EXPENSE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTSA portion of what is reported to the state as administrative expenses is attributed to what Federal Health Reform considers quality improvement expenses, meaning the federal government recognizes that these represent costs that lead to overall improvements in health care versus simply a routine business expense, and as a result will be considered a medical benefit expense for purposes of federal MLR calculations.Those quality improvement expenses include such items as:-Improvements in health outcomes brought about by case management and disease management programs,-Actions taken to help prevent hospital readmissions through such things as discharge planning and counseling,-Wellness and community health promotional activities, and-Health information technology that is used to help measure clinical effectiveness and predictive modeling.The proposed rates will more accurately reflect the true operating expense of administering the federal Health Care Reform legislation through the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange. The changes in the health insurance market required building and implementing an entirely new sales channel from what had primarily been a business-to-business marketplace.This required:-The implementation of a new sales call center that saw extended open enrollment deadlines in 2014,-The hiring of additional staff,-Increased direct-to-consumer communication costs to educate consumers about new products and how to access those products, and-The building and implementation of new products, new infrastructure for the continued improvements and changes to the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange and for the implementation of additional mandates for the federal Health Care Reform.Operating expenses - including quality improvement initiatives but excluding federal and state taxes, fees and assessments, and broker commissions - represent 8.7% of premium in small group qualified health plans and 8.4% in individual qualified health plans.VI. REGULATION 146Regulation 146 was a market stabilization mechanism for the individual and small group pools that was in effect prior to the adoption of the ACA. Similar to the ACA Risk Adjustment program, Reg. 146 attempted to equalize the risk within the small group and individual markets by assessing a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and used this revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members. Because of the redundancy with the new risk adjustment program, Reg. 146 is being phased out. The Department of Financial Services is requiring plans to distribute all outstanding compensations through premium adjustments in 2015 and 2016. This distribution plan results in a reduction in the small group qualified health plan premium of 0.3% and in individual premium of about 1%.",Review Complete,9.23,78124NY091,ExcellusBCBS EPO Base,"Excellus Health Plan, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Annual,20.82,20.82,RC

The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, the number of members (for family plans) and their ages, and where in Oklahoma the group is located.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of actions to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high&#8208;cost health care services.",Review Complete,15.49,53524OK006,OK Sm Grp Off Exchange,Coventry Health and Life,OKLAHOMA,OK,Annual,15.49,15.49,RC

The actual HHS Threshold rate increase for first quarter 2015 is 9.13% for HMO plans, 11.47% for POS plans and 6.26% for PPO plans.Anthem provided many exhibits of the pieces that make up the rate increase. We requested further information regarding the tobacco rating, the network adjustments, the cost of the Federal Mental Health Parity Final Rule, and the health insurer provider Fee. Anthem provided the additional information to justify these assumptions.We concluded that the proposed rate increase is not unreasonable based on the expected amount of claim payments, administrative expenses, and profit. We determined that the proposed increase satisfies the requirements of Maine law that the rates not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.We found the data and methods used to estimate next year&rsquo;s claims, which make up 80.5% of the premium, to be appropriate. The annual medical trend was 7.1% for all products. With the impact of rating band modifications, the minimum is a decrease of 2.3% and maximum increase is 16.10%.The Maine Bureau of Insurance felt that Anthem met their MLR.

This increase is anticipated to impact approximately 313 small group members.  It&rsquo;s important to note that a subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate increase could be higher or lower depending on the benefit plan selected, geographic location, age of the subscribers, dependent coverage and other factors.   It should also be noted that we are projecting that we will spend in excess of 87% of every health insurance dollar directly on medical care this year, beyond federal standards. More technically, our projected medical loss ratio, as defined by the ACA, for all small group products under the Anthem Maine legal entity will meet the minimum MLR requirement.Financial ExperienceIn 2012 Anthem reported an 85.7% ACA medical loss ratio (MLR) for all Small Group plans, which exceeded the federal MLR requirement of 80%.  Anthem was not required to issue rebates in as more than 80% of the premium dollar was spent on medical care and quality programs, as required by the ACA.  Anthem expects the rate increase to cover projected medical trends and it will yield an ACA-defined medical loss ratio well above 80% for POS products.  In total Anthem expects the rates for the small group pool will yield an ACA defined medical loss ratio of 87.1% in 2015. This means that approximately eighty seven cents of each premium dollar are expected to go to covering medical expenses and quality programs.Changes in Medical CostsThe primary driver of the premium increase is the continued increase in the cost of healthcare.  The increases are associated with increases in the&ldquo;unit&rdquo; cost of services primarily from hospitals, physicians and pharmaceutical companies, coupled with increases in the consumption of services, or&ldquo;utilization&rdquo;, by members.  Increases in the unit costs of services are driven by many things, including technology advances, cost shifting to private insurers from inadequate Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement, general inflationary pressures, and a variety of other factors.  Changes in utilization of services can be driven by benefit design, economic conditions, and many other factors.  Within the projected medical trends, Anthem anticipates small increases from higher utilization, while the majority of the increases are associated with higher unit costs. Anthem believes its projected medical trends are reasonable, and fall within the range of industry norms.What is Anthem doing to keep premiums affordable?Anthem is investing in many initiatives to reduce the cost of care, promote wellness and preventive care for our members and communities, as well as working with providers to encourage high-quality, evidence-based care, which costs less over time.We are focusing on patient-centered primary care to ensure coordination of care among all settings, rewarding hospitals and physicians for quality and outcomes such as reducing or eliminating avoidable readmissions, and providing the data that our providers need to assist them in managing a patient&rsquo;s overall condition.We are dedicated to working with our members to find health coverage plans that are the most appropriate, beneficial and affordable for their needs.  Also, to help our members manage costs, we continue to negotiate the best possible rates for covered products and provider services, and we are making more tools available to help members better manage health and out-of-pocket costs.As a Maine based company that has done business here for 75 years, we care about our customers and the community.  We share the concerns raised by our members over the rising costs of health care services and the corresponding impact they have on premiums, particularly in this challenging economy.

The NCDOI has determined that the rate increase satisfies the requirements of North Carolina law that the rates are adequate, not excessive, and not unfairly discriminatory. NCDOI&rsquo;s decision on the proposed rate increase was based upon the following:The historical data used by the company underlying the proposed rate increase is the North Carolina individual non-grandfathered experience for calendar year 2013 with 3 months of run-out. Actual ACA enrollment and age/gender distributions are updated through 5/31/2014.The filing complies with North Carolina laws and regulations, Federal laws, and applicable Actuarial Standards of Practice. The benefits provided are reasonable in relation to the approved premiums charged.The insurer&rsquo;s assumptions used in projecting costs are reasonable, including annual trend assumptions.The approved rate increase is not unreasonable based upon the expected claim payments, administrative expenses, and margin. The N.C. individual medical loss ratio is expected to exceed an 80% Federal MLR.NCDOI&rsquo;s determination included consideration of the following factors, as applicable:Medical cost trend changes by major service categoriesChanges in utilization of services (i.e., hospital care, pharmaceuticals, doctors&rsquo; office visits) by major service categoriesCost-sharing changes by major service categoriesChanges in benefitsChanges in enrollee risk profileImpact of over- or under-estimate of medical trend in previous years on the current rateReserve needsAdministrative costs related to programs that improve health care qualityOther administrative costsApplicable taxes and licensing or regulatory feesMedical loss ratioThe insurer&rsquo;s capital and surplus",Not Applicable,"August 27 2014Justification of Rate Increase, Individual Affordable Care Act MarketScope and Range of the Rate IncreaseThe overall requested rate increase for Individuals in the ACA single Risk pool is 13.5 percent. this is before any impacts due to member aging.The average increase by product isBlue Advantage 15.2 percentBlue Select 17.0 percentBlue Value 7.1 percentAn individual member may see rate changes that vary significantly from the figures listed above. This may be for a variety of reasons including age, geographic location, benefit plan design, product and smoking status. Individuals will also receive higher increases due to aging if they have crossed a rating age band. Rating factors vary significantly for children versus adults, 21 and over, and also change each year for adults 21 to 64 in accordance with ACA prescribed rating rules. Individuals may also see large changes in billed premiums as a result of changes in eligibility for subsidies or amounts of government provided premium tax credits to purchase coverage on the health insurance Marketplace. This will happen in markets where the second lowest cost Silver plan has changed to a different plan than the year before. The rates submitted by Blue Cross Blue Shield are prior to premium tax credits, therefore the 13.5 percent only reflects the requested change for total premium cost. Individual members will need to go to the marketplace to determine new subsidy amounts they are eligible for to cover premium costs.This filing impacts 317,950 members currently enrolled in our individual ACA market both on and off the Exchange as of July 31 2014. The premiums for this coverage will comply with all the major market reforms established by the ACA that went into effect January 1 2014. Blue cross Blue Shield of North Carolina is committed to improving the health care system in North Carolina, we will continue to work with doctors, hospitals and others to bring our customers innovative solution that simplify the health care system, improve efficiency and outcomes, and help rein in costs.Summary of DriversThe projected risk of the population. Enrollment demographics available at the time of this filing indicated an older and sicker pool than expected at the time 2014 policies were priced. The extension of Transition policies in the Individual market to allow previous customers to keep their pre ACA plans kept many younger, healthier individuals out of the ACA risk pool. Risk selection changes compared to 2014 pricing accounts for approximately 7.2 percent of the increase.Medical trend, unit cost and utilization. increases in provider reimbursement levels and expected medical service utilization accounts for a portion of our requested increase. New drugs, notably the introduction of expensive Hepatitis C treatments such as Sovaldi were not priced for in 2014 and will increase rates in 2015. rising outpatient costs are also a contributing factor to the increase. BCBSNC efforts to contract with providers for limited and tiered network products have helped reduce cost trends overall for the block by over 3 percent versus 2013 levels.We also believe these products will help better manage utilization by steering patients to more efficient or lower cost providers. The overall increase in medical trend contributes to approximately 3.2 percent of the increase.New benefits covered, notably expansion of mental health services to include residential treatment centers, contributes approximately 0.7 percent.Transitional Reinsurance. Due to reductions in the funding of the program available nationally to issuers of Individual ACA plans from 10 Billion Dollars in 2014 to 6 Billion Dollars in 2015, we expect to receive lower credits as a percentage of total premiums in 2015 compared to our pricing in 2014. This contributes to approximately 1.4 percent of our increase.Changes in administrative expenses, taxes, and fees contribute approximately 0.9 percent.We are not requesting any increase in our risk margin or contribution to surplus as a percent of premium in this rate filing, nor do we project to pay medical Loss Ratio rebates as a result of the premium rates requested. In other words, we expect to continue to spend over 80 percent of premium after taxes on qualified medical expenses in 2015 just as we priced in 2014.As demonstrated in our filed 2013 Supplemental Health Care Exhibit, BCBSNC took a 60.4 Million Dollar loss on the Individual segment in 2013 primarily due to higher medical and administrative costs than expected relative to premiums charged.",Review Complete,15.19,11512NC006,Blue  Advantage,Blue Cross and Blue Shield of NC,NORTH CAROLINA,NC,Annual,15.19,15.19,RC

Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.For Product 61430KS012 the current enrollment is 1,251. These members will have an approximate rate increase of 12.8%.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 7.2%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer individuals in Kansas a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes decreased expected medical costs by an average of 2.1%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&#61623;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&#61623; Changes to required taxes and feesWill Premiums for All Small Group Plans Increase 12.8%?No, the 12.8% is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down, others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, the number of members (for family plans) and their ages, where in Kansas the subscriber is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have.

However, early indications show members signing up for ACA are significantly older and more risky than previously projected.  This difference in risk profile from previous projections is partially due to the transitional policy for non-ACA compliant plans, and is a market wide occurrence, not company specific.CHANGES IN MEDICAL SERVICE COSTSThe projection of claims from the experience period to the effective period assumes a 7 percent annual trend.  This claim assumption is based on analysis of the health plan&rsquo;s recent and expected experience.  This overall trend covers projected changes in utilization, unit costs and mix and intensity of services, for medical and pharmacy claims combined.CHANGES IN BENEFITSThere were no changes in benefits from 2014 to 2015, so no impact to the rate increase.ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED PROFITSDHP targets a loss ratio of 92 percent for its individual block of business.

We expect medical costs to go up 8.5%, excluding the effect of benefit changes. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsSeveral requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates.

The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the member chooses, when the member&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for an enrolling individual, where in Nebraska the member is located, and which members use tobacco.  Changes in the premium will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above Nebraska&rsquo;s 80% requirement for Individual business.

By pooling the populations covered by our products, we protectindividuals from the unaffordable and potentially ruinous costs associated with significantillnesses or injuries. Our products promote preventive care, health maintenance and healthimprovement, and we have in place strong utilization management programs that supportmembers who require medical care and assure that they have access to high value care whileavoiding unnecessary costs.BCBSVT also works with providers to dampen cost increases through reimbursement strategiesthat include incentives to both provide and properly manage care. BCBSVT&rsquo;s vision is atransformed health care system in which every Vermonter has health care coverage, andreceives timely, effective, affordable care. None of this work is possible unless BCBSVTremains financially strong, and that requires that we be allowed to charge rates that coverthe medical expenses of the populations we serve.The purpose of this rate filing is to provide the rates and a description of the ratedevelopment for the products that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont (BCBSVT) isproposing to be offered in the Vermont Exchange, effective January 1, 2015.&bull; BCBSVT is proposing an average rate increase of 9.8 percent across all Exchange plans.This ranges from a 4.8 percent increase to an 11.8 percent increase.&bull; There are an estimated 35,037 contracts (57,867 members) currently enrolled withBCBSVT in a Qualified Health Plan.Significant medical price increases were partially offset by favorable membership assumptionsand reductions in BCBSVT administrative expenses. Combined, these factors produced a 3.3percent increase in rates. The remainder of the 9.8 percent increase was driven by changesrelated to federal and state health care reforms, including an increase in the federal fee thatis included in Exchange pricing, a reduction in federal subsidies of the premiums on Vermont&rsquo;snew Exchange, and a modest expansion of dental benefits for children.&bull; The federal government assesses a charge on all health plans to subsidize Exchangecoverage for the three year-period between 2014 and 2016, through its TransitionalReinsurance Program. The subsidy is reduced in 2015 and 2016, before beingeliminated entirely in 2017. Because the premium subsidy is being reduced from anestimated seven percent to an estimated three percent in 2015, it will require groupsand members to pay 4.0 percent more for their coverage.&bull; The federal insurer fee established by the Affordable Care Act is used to providesubsidies to low-income people to help them afford to purchase Exchange products.This fee is increasing by more than 40 percent, resulting in a 0.9 percent increase inpremium for Exchange products.&bull; The Green Mountain Care Board approved a change to enhance coverage for dentalservices for children. The change provides that children covered through the non-CDHPExchange products will have access to cleanings and other services with no costsharing requirement. The enhancement in coverage raises the premium by 0.5percent.&bull; Most deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums and co-pays in Exchange plans remainunchanged from 2014 to 2015. As overall costs increase and the amounts that memberspay in cost-sharing contributions stays the same, more of the total cost is transferredto premiums. This had an impact of 0.8 percent on premium.These four items drive an increase of 6.3 percent required solely because of mandatedchanges associated with the Affordable Care Act and Vermont benefit decisions.In the absence of mandated changes associated with the Affordable Care Act and Vermontbenefit decisions, a 3.3 percent increase would have been requested:&bull; An estimate of increases in the amounts providers are paid was included in 2014Exchange rates. Increases beyond those assumptions that have already occurred in2014, or that are projected to occur before the end of 2014, drive a premium increaseof 2.9 percent. This primarily includes hospital payments under budgets approved bythe Green Mountain Care Board and prescription drug prices.&bull; Amounts providers are paid are expected to increase by 4.8 percent in 2015. Thisincrease flows directly to premium.&bull; BCBSVT assumes that&ldquo;new members&rdquo; who have or will enroll in our qualified healthplans will prove to be significantly healthier on average than those previously insuredin individual and small group products. This assumption creates a premium decrease of2.5 percent.&bull; Other adjustments to the assumptions used in the 2014 rate development cumulativelyhave the effect of reducing the required rate increase by 1.8 percent. These includeitems such as updating the experience base to calendar year 2013 and observing themix of membership actually enrolled on the Exchange in 2014. Notably, BCBSVT has:o Reduced the projected medical utilization&ldquo;trend&rdquo; (the expected increases inoverall medical use) to zero,o Reduced its administrative expense fees, ando Included a one percent contribution to reserves, an amount that is lower thanit would normally require for the protection of Exchange members.BCBSVT understands the importance of adequately funding our health care system, to keep itstrong and accessible. Since the factors driving this rate increase are almost entirely relatedto federal policy changes and increases in prices paid to medical providers in Vermont, webelieve that there is no way to further reduce these rates without underfunding the healthcare coverage on which Vermonters rely",Review Complete,7.70,13627VT034,EPO,Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont,VERMONT,VT,Annual,11.16,11.16,FJCS

Additionally, simple services can be replaced with more complex services over time, which is known as mix intensity trend. As an example, a relatively low-cost X-ray may be replaced by a relatively high-cost MRI scan.

Under Maryland law, rates may not be inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.  Each rate filing is reviewed on its own merits.  The Commissioner&rsquo;s rate decisions must be based on statistical analysis and reasonable assumptions.  To assist the Commissioner in making these decisions, Maryland Insurance Administration (&ldquo;MIA&rdquo;) actuaries examine the data, methods and assumptions used by each insurer, non-profit health service plan, or HMO (&ldquo;carrier&rdquo;).  They review numerous factors related to proposed premium rates, including the carrier&rsquo;s actual and projected claims experience, medical and prescription costs, administrative costs, and profits or losses.  The Commissioner also considers the impact premium rates will have on Maryland consumers.  Under the federal Affordable Care Act and Maryland law, in the individual and small group markets, 80 cents of every premium dollar must be spent on paying claims or on quality improvement activities that figure increases to 85 cents in the large group market.  If an insurance carrier does not meet these targets, the carrier must pay rebates to policyholders.Modifications to Requested Premium Rates and Basis of ModificationsGroup Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc. submitted a rate filing on May 1, 2014, requesting an average rate increase of 38.1%.  On May 23, 2014, the Company amended its filing to request an average rate increase of 30.2%.  The amended rate filing reflected certain minor adjustments in response to MIA objections, such as modifying its assumptions about projected average age and the projected cost and utilization of dental benefits.  The most significant change, however, was a reduction in the Company&rsquo;s projections about the morbidity of its 2015 individual market enrollees as compared with the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  Specifically, in its amended filing, the Company assigned to its projected 2015 individual market enrollees a morbidity factor that was 1.60 times the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  In its May 1, 2014 filing, the Company had assumed a morbidity factor of 1.75.  The MIA proceeded to review the amended May 23, 2014 filing.The MIA concluded that certain of the Company&rsquo;s data, methods, and assumptions were not well supported, including certain assumptions about the projected morbidity of its individual product enrollees in 2015.  In particular, the Company had not adequately supported its assumptions regarding the number of small group enrollees projected to migrate to its individual products, or its assumptions about the morbidity levels of previously uninsured enrollees.  The MIA further concluded that the Company&rsquo;s actual experience during the first half of 2014, as well as other considerations relating to actual and projected enrollment in the 2014 and 2015 individual market, did not support a 1.60 morbidity factor.  The Commissioner also concluded that the requested average premium rate increase of 30.2% would have an abrupt, substantial, and adverse impact on the approximately 12,714 Marylanders currently enrolled in Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s Affordable Care Act-compliant plans in the individual market, and would introduce a high level of volatility into Maryland&rsquo;s individual health insurance market.The MIA prescribed a morbidity factor of 1.40, rather than the Company&rsquo;s requested morbidity factor of 1.60.  This modification resulted in an approximately 10.6% reduction in the Company&rsquo;s proposed premium rates for 2015.As modified during the rate review process, Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s premium rates for 2015 reflect an approximately 16.2% increase as compared with its premium rates for 2014.&emsp;DeterminationPursuant to&sect; 11-603(c)(2) of the Insurance Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, the Commissioner has determined that the Company&rsquo;s premium rates,  as modified during the rate review process, are not inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.Rate Review Standards and ConsiderationsThe Insurance Commissioner approves health insurance rates in Maryland.

The rates set forth in this filing were calculated as directed in the MIA Order, and CareFirst believes that they are inadequate.Accordingly, while the rates in this submission are filed as directed by the MIA Order and based upon the prescribed morbidity factor of 1.40, the information contained in this Actuarial Memorandum reflects a morbidity factor of 1.60.1.	SCOPE AND RANGE OF THE RATE INCREASE: CF is proposing to raise annual premiums by 16.2%, prior to age band changes. (For CFI the proposed renewal is 11.9%.) The range is 13.6% to 20.1%. (For renewing customers, an age band change adds 2.6% to the renewal, on average, with a range of 0.0% to 4.7% for ages 22 and upwards per the CMS age curve.)The primary factors driving this proposed change in premium rates are:a)	Projected significant increase in membership volumes with average morbidities higher than 2014.b)	Migration in the pool of former enrollees in Maryland&rsquo;s high risk pool the Maryland Health Insurance Plan (MHIP).c)	An aging of the pool of members.d)	An increase in the cost of medical care delivery in the form of claims trend driven by increases in both unit cost and utilization.e)	An increase in the health insurer fee.2.	FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE OF THE PRODUCT: The incurred period is 1-1-13 through 12-31-13. Total premiums and allowed claims for the period were $53,936,342 and $62,972,468, respectively.A.	Changes in the Morbidity of the Population Insured: CareFirst calculated its proposed rates based upon a morbidity factor of 1.60 however, the rates in this filing are calculated based upon a morbidity factor of 1.40 as ordered by the MIA Order.CareFirst estimates a morbidity risk factor of 1.60 for 2015 as relayed through the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filings (SERFF) on 5-23-14. Our 1.60 factor was computed after consideration for the morbidity risk factor that was included in the 2014 filed and approved rates.  The morbidity risk factor projections are based upon the model that supported CareFirst&rsquo;s 2014 rate filings.  The model compares known and estimated allowed claims costs per member per month (pmpm) for 2013 to project the cost of various categories of the estimated 2015 membership.These categories are based upon the prior status of the 2015 membership - previous CareFirst members (medically underwritten under 65 Individuals, MHIP, Group) and New Entrants sorted by income (less than 200% FPL, greater than 200% FPL).  The risk factor for each category is expressed in terms of allowed claims pmpm cost, and is calculated by comparing the category pmpm claims cost to the 2013 CareFirst Individual membership pmpm cost.  More than 50% of the projected 2015 membership is included in categories supported by actual claims data supporting the previous CareFirst member categories.  The New Entrants&rsquo; categories use projected risk scores based upon a Hilltop study (Basic Health Plan) for the members less than 200% FPL and the Group factor for the greater than 200% FPL members. The Group factor is based upon the almost 250 thousand CareFirst Small Group members that have for decades been community rated and guaranteed issue as is now required under ACA for Individual enrollees. CareFirst&rsquo;s judgment is that this extremely large community rated, guaranteed issue small group pool of members is most representative of the New Entrants greater than 200% FPL.B.	Changes in Demographics: Comparing the overall CareFirst member-level average age as of 12-31-12 to 3-31-14, the average age has increased by 4.5 years from 34.0 to 38.5. Age factors will account for a portion of the corresponding increase in claims cost. We find the CMS age curve spread of 3 to 1 to be lower than the 4.5 to 1 that is more correlated with expected claims costs. We have therefore adjusted expected claims costs accordingly in the experience period (EP) index rate projection in the other category.C.	Trend Factors (Cost-Utilization): The proposed trend of 6.5% is a reduction of 270 basis points from 2014&rsquo;s 9.2%. The improvement is concentrated in outpatient hospital and prescription drug services which comprise 32% of total allowed claims.D.	Projected Loss Ratio: Our projected NAIC DICR for MLR purposes is 83.9%, above the 80.0% minimum of Public Health Service Act (PHSA) 218.3.	CHANGES IN MEDICAL SERVICE COSTS: The experience period index rate is a key component driving the renewal. Last year&rsquo;s implicit 2013 index rate was $211 ($193 x trend of 9.2%). The actual for 2013 is $199 for a favorable variance of -6%.4.	CHANGES IN BENEFITS: For CareFirst&rsquo;s Individual offerings in Maryland, our portfolio is not changing. We will still offer 15 benefit plans&ndash; 1 Young Adult-Catastrophic, 4 Bronze, 4 Silver, 4 Gold and 2 Platinum. We have recalculated the costs of Essential Health Benefits (EHB) as well as Non-EHBs.a)	Per COMAR 31.10.39 Utilization Review of Treatment for Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders, Bulletin 14-07 and due to the passage of SB 759-HB 783, Coverage for Autism Spectrum Disorders, we have calculated an increase in claims of $3 per member per month (PMPM) for 2015. This is largely for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) treatments and is a state-mandated EHB benefit. The $3 PMPM is derived from an incidence assumption of 1 in 68 children ages 1-19, an uptake rate of 1 in 3 and an intensity rate of $40,000 to $95,000 per year depending on age.b)	Other adjustments were made for pediatric dental, mandatory generics, a new hepatitis C prescription drug, Sovaldi, and maternity.c)	Other Adjustments: CareFirst (CF) is proposing to introduce an incentive program (IP) whereby members can earn medical expense debit cards of as much as $250 annually, for an individual ($650 for a family). The cards must be utilized for qualified medical expenses such as deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket costs. The scope includes all benefit plans within CF&rsquo;s portfolio, On and Off the Exchange. This is being done in a revenue-neutral way. That is, the cost to CF of the incentive payments was chosen such that they match the expected savings to CF from more efficacious health care delivery. HealthyBlue (HB) was first launched effective 10-1-10 with the objective of motivating and rewarding greater engagement by the member in his or her health, improved wellness and prevention and better provider coordination and quality. As we sought to respond to feedback about HB, subsequent versions were released on 1-1-12 and 10-1-12. This IP represents an evolution of the HB concept. Further, it joins the tenets of HB with our Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) program which was launched on January, 2011.Our aim is that this IP will improve our members&rsquo; health.d)	Included are decreases to claims costs for a change in our Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) in 2014.e)	Membership Projections: We had projected 58% of enrollment in HMO-based plans as of 12-31-14 in our 2014 filings. Actual data as of 4-10-14 indicates that HMO comprises 69% of our CFI members. We had also expected 5% of enrollment in Platinum plans versus actuals of 13%. We incorporated both of these facts in projecting 12-31-15 enrollment.f)	    For the Young Adult-Catastrophic plan, the deductible-out-of-pocket maximum has been raised from $6,350 to $6,600 per year.g)	Also, per HB 0625, oral chemotherapy coverage has been mandated. The cost of reducing cost shares to not exceed those of intravenous chemotherapy has been deemed negligible.h)	Diabetic supplies have been moved to $0 copays. The deductible applies for H.S.A. plans but not for non-H.S.A.s with negligible price impact.i)	    Retail Clinics such as urgent care centers will have reduced copays to match the PCP rather than specialist copay with negligible price impact.j)	    A 5-tiered structure (Generics-Preferred, Generics-Non-Preferred, Brand Name-Preferred, Brand Name-Non-Preferred, Specialty) is currently used for approximately 20% of our benefits. This is changing to 4-tier structure by collapsing the Generics tiers.5.	ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED CONTRIBUTION TO RESERVE: The 2015 desired incurred claims ratio (DICR) is 79.3%.A.	Administrative Expense Load: PMPMs increased by 3% versus 2014.B.	CtR&amp; Risk Margin: Remains at 0.0%, break-even.C.	Taxes and Fees:I.	Community Health Investment of 2.0%.II.

1328291,59765,Individual,ST,01/01/2015,true,09/25/2014,10/08/2014,Not Unreasonable,"The State of Idaho reviewed this rate increase request and found it to be not unreasonable. The State's review was concentrated on compliance of the issuer's rate increase request with Idaho laws and regulations and also included fulfillment of the process for the review of unreasonable rate increases established under Section 2794 of the Public Health Service Act.The average annual rate change for this filing is 6.2%, which is less than the rate change threshold of 10%. Due to the way plan and product ID were assigned, the Gold plan increase of 10.39% was identified by CMS as exceeding the threshold. Given that determination, the Idaho Department of Insurance is providing comments based on the review of the overall rate increase request.The health trend for this filing is an assumption of 7% annually, which Regence has justified.The remaining increase is due to new federal fees and adjustments in relative plan cost relationships. We reviewed the data and assumptions that Regence used in determining these adjustments and found them not unreasonable. The company's projected risk margin upon implementing this increase is 2.0%.After this rate increase, the company expects to pay 77.4% of premium collected as claims. After allowable adjustments, the projected MLR calculation yields 83.3% which exceeds the federal minimum loss ratio requirement of 80%.",Not Applicable,"Effective January 1, 2014 the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) required plans to meet certain plan design and benefit requirements. BridgeSpan Health Company (BridgeSpan) filed a new portfolio of products effective January 1, 2014 to meet these new ACA requirements.This rate filing is effective January 1, 2015 and is the second rate filing for these new ACA-compliant plans.  This filing relies on Regence entity experience, which  has approximately 13,000 members enrolled in this line of business as of April 2014.  This filing is based on claims experience from January 2013 through December 2013, with claims paid through April 2014.Rate ChangeThe average rate change for plans effective January 1, 2015 is 6.2%, which is an average rate change of about $22 per member per month.  Because 6.2% (or about $22) is an average, it is possible to have a different rate change.  Factors affecting a member's premium include age, geographic area, tobacco use, family composition, and product.Contributing Factors - ClaimsThe main factor for the rate change is the increasing cost of medical care.  This filing reflects projected claims expenses increasing approximately 7% annually.Another factor contributing to the rate change is the expected phase down of the federal reinsurance program beginning in 2015, which has contributed approximately 3% to the rate change  The ACA introduced this temporary program to mitigate rate increases in 2014 by reimbursing a portion of large claims, and it will phase out by 2017.A mitigating factor to the rate change is the projected change in the overall health status of the covered population from 2014 to 2015. Because pool health status is expected to improve this has a favorable impact to the rate change.Contributing Factors - Non-ClaimsBridgeSpan is committed to using member premium dollars responsibly and consistently pays out a high percentage of premium dollars towards member claims.  BridgeSpan expects this rate filing to exceed the ACA&rsquo;s minimum Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) requirement.Administrative expenses are expected to be 13.6% of premium, compared to 15.3% in the 2014 rates.  Regulatory payments including taxes and fees required by the ACA are expected to be 7.0%, compared to 6.2% in the 2014 rates.  Risk and contingency estimates to account for inherent variability in predicting future claims and anticipated contribution to surplus are included as 2.0% of premium, compared to 2.0% in the 2014 rates.Financial ExperienceThese products were introduced effective January 1, 2014, and a full year of financial experience is not yet available.",Review Complete,10.39,59765ID001,BridgeSpan Exchange Gold,BridgeSpan Health Company,IDAHO,ID,Annual,10.39,10.39,RC

Therefore, the IID approved the WHPI filing.",Not Applicable,"URRT Part II Description of Requested Rate IncreaseWellmark Health Plan of IowaIndividual HealthEffective January 1, 2015Scope and Range of Rate IncreaseWellmark Health Plan of Iowa, Inc has 2,177 policyholders representing 3,212 members in individual Affordable Care Act, ACA, plans as of May 2014.  The requested average rate increase for all of these plans is 11.9%, and will be effective January 1, 2015. The rate increase varies by plan and region, with a low of 5.9% and a high of 17.5%.  Subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate changes will vary depending on the benefit plan selected, age of the members on the policy, and dependent coverage.Financial Experience of the ProductThese ACA plans were introduced in 2014, and so as of the time of this rate request, there is only a limited amount of experience data available.  Rates for 2015 were therefore based on experience from Wellmark&rsquo;s existing individual business, and projected member movement from the entire insured and uninsured population.From the little claims experience that was available at the time of this rate request, the claims experience is higher for this business than was projected last year.  Therefore the majority of the rate request is due to higher expected claims experience.The proposed rate increase is expected to produce a medical loss ratio, MLR, of 88.8%.  It should be noted that the projected MLR meets the minimum requirement of 80.0% defined in the ACA.  If the actual MLR were to fall below this level, such as if actual claim costs turn out to be lower than expected, Wellmark would pay rebates to members as required by the ACA.Changes in Medical Service CostsAnnual trend of 4.1% was used to project claims from the experience period into the rating period. This trend assumption includes any change in service costs and utilization. Multi year trend averages were reviewed to arrive at the assumed trend amount.Changes in BenefitsThere is one plan that has changes in its benefits effective with this filing for January 1, 2015.For SimplyBlue 5000 HMO, the coinsurance changed from 40% to 30% and the out of pocket amounts changed from $6,250 for single and $12,500 for family to $6,600 for single and $13,200 for family.  There are now any 2 office exam occurrences at a $0 copay instead of 2 primary care office exam occurrences at a $0 copay, and there is an inclusion of a drug card with a tier 1 copay of $15 instead of all drugs applying deductible and coinsurance.Administrative Costs and Anticipated ProfitsThe main drivers of administrative expenses are employee salaries and benefits, broker and agent commissions, and various governmental taxes and fees. We strive to lower our administrative expenses, as well as the underlying cost of care, in order to provide the best value to our customers.For this rate request, administrative costs in aggregate have decreased as a percent of premium from the prior rating period. The same holds for anticipated profit, as it was reduced from 3.3% in the prior rating period to 0.0% in the projected rating period. Typically, a nominal margin is needed to help ensure Wellmark&rsquo;s long term viability.",Review Complete,16.82,25896IA020,SimplyBlue FB,Wellmark Health Plan of Iowa,IOWA,IA,Annual,16.82,16.82,RC

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 12.5%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. As of April 2014, approximately 37,000 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 10.7%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in New Jersey, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&bull; Expenses for emergency treatment have increased 15%.&bull; The use of outpatient hospital services has increased 9%.&bull; Costs for pharmacy prescriptions have gone up 10%.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsThe rates in this filing reflect the impacts of a number of ACA-related requirements, including changes to taxes and fees and changes to benefit requirements.Will Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 12.5%?No, the 12.5% is an average. Rate changes differ by product due to the impact of benefit changes. These average increases are:&bull; 12.4% for Product (HMO)&bull; 12.5% for Product (POS)The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, and the age and family size for enrolling employees.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of actions to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&bull; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Aetna Navigator, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services.

These include:&bull;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&bull; Changes to required taxes and fees&bull; Phase-out of the Transtional Reinsurance Program which increases rates for plans issued to individualsWill Premiums for All Individuals Increase 12.8%?No, the 12.8% is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down. Others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the individual chooses, the age and family size for enrolling employees, where in Oklahoma the individual is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Individual business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&bull; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have.

We found no instances where the assumptions or pricing factors were unreasonable or inconsistent with market reform implementation constraints and guidelines.  The development process of the index rate through the consumer adjusted index rate was compliant with the federal instructions and the calibrations are justifiable.The projected medical loss ratio was 88.9%, was calculated according to the federal instructions, and exceeds the minimum of 80%.We believe that the requested rate increase is not unreasonable.",Not Applicable,"URRT Part II Description of Requested Rate IncreaseWellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of IowaIndividual HealthEffective January 1 2015Scope and Range of Rate IncreaseWellmark Inc has 9360 policyholders representing 15062 members in individual Affordable Care Act ACA plans as of May 2014.

Subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate changes will vary depending on the benefit plan selected, age of the members on the policy, and dependent coverage.Financial Experience of the ProductThese ACA plans were introduced in 2014, and so as of the time of this rate request, there is only a limited amount of experience data available.  Rates for 2015 were therefore based on experience from Wellmark&rsquo;s existing individual business, and projected member movement from the entire insured and uninsured population.From the little claims experience that was available at the time of this rate request, the claims experience is higher for this business than was projected last year.  Therefore the majority of the rate request is due to higher expected claims experience.The proposed rate increase is expected to produce a medical loss ratio MLR of 88.9%.  It should be noted that the projected MLR meets the minimum requirement of 80.0% defined in the ACA.  If the actual MLR were to fall below this level such as if actual claim costs turn out to be lower than expected, Wellmark would pay rebates to members as required by the ACA.Changes in Medical Service CostsAnnual trend of 4.1% was used to project claims from the experience period into the rating period. This trend assumption includes any change in service costs and utilization. Multi year trend averages were reviewed to arrive at the assumed trend amount.Changes in BenefitsThere are three plans that have changes in their benefits effective with this filing for January 1, 2015.For CompleteBlue 3500 PPO the coinsurance changed from 40% to 30%, the out of pocket amounts changed from $6,250 for single and $12,500 for family to $6,600 for single and $13,200 for family, and the deductible of $250 was removed from the drug card along with changing the preferred specialty copay from $70 to $100.For myBlue HSA Silver 3200 PPO members now have benefits after the single deductible is met, and they no longer have to wait until the entire family deductible is met.For EnhancedBlue 1000 PPO  the preferred specialty copay for the drug card was changed from $70 to $100.Administrative Costs and Anticipated ProfitsThe main drivers of administrative expenses are employee salaries and benefits, broker and agent commissions, and various governmental taxes and fees. We strive to lower our administrative expenses, as well as the underlying cost of care, in order to provide the best value to our customers.For this rate request, administrative costs in aggregate have decreased as a percent of premium from the prior rating period.

Under Maryland law, rates may not be inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or excessive in relation to benefits. Each rate filing is reviewed on its own merits. The Commissioner&rsquo;s rate decisions must be based on statistical analysis and reasonable assumptions. To assist the Commissioner in making these decisions, Maryland Insurance Administration (&ldquo;MIA&rdquo;) actuaries examine the data, methods and assumptions used by each insurer, non-profit health service plan, or HMO (&ldquo;carrier&rdquo;). They review numerous factors related to proposed premium rates, including the carrier&rsquo;s actual and projected claims experience, medical and prescription costs, administrative costs, and profits or losses. The Commissioner also considers the impact premium rates will have on Maryland consumers. Under the federal Affordable Care Act and Maryland law, in the individual and small group markets, 80 cents of every premium dollar must be spent on paying claims or on quality improvement activities that figure increases to 85 cents in the large group market. If an insurance carrier does not meet these targets, the carrier must pay rebates to policyholders.Considerations and Modifications to Requested Premium RatesThe Company revised its projected average age for small group enrollees, resulting in an increase in proposed rates of approximately +0.1%.Final DeterminationPursuant to&sect; 11-603(c)(2) of the Insurance Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, the Commissioner has determined that the Company&rsquo;s requested premium rates, as modified during the rate review process, are not inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.",Not Applicable,"GENERAL INFORMATION:Company Legal Name: BlueChoice, Inc. (NAIC 96202).State: Maryland.HIOS Issuer ID: 28,137.Market: Small Groups (On&amp; Off Exchange).Effective Date: January 1, 2015 and quarterly incremental trend increases.1.	SCOPE AND RANGE OF THE RATE INCREASE: CF is proposing to raise annual premiums by 5.7% on average in 1Q15, prior to age band changes. (For CFI the proposed renewal is 5.9%.) The range is 3.8% to 11.9%. (For renewing customers, an age band change adds 2.6% to the renewal, on average, with a range of 0.0% to 4.7% for ages 22 and upwards per the CMS age curve.)The primary factors driving this proposed change in premium rates are:a. An increase in the cost of medical care delivery in the form of claims trend driven by increases in both unit cost and utilization.b. An increase in the health insurer fee.c. A smaller, less healthy pool due to expected conversion of small groups to self-funding or alternative funding arrangements.2.	FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE OF THE PRODUCT: The incurred period is January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013. Total premiums and allowed claims for the period were $771,614,800 and $757,572,770, respectively.a. Changes in the Morbidity of the Population Insured: For 2015 we are adjusting allowed claims upwards by about 3% in the Other category in the index rate projection driven primarily by approximately 10% of the healthiest groups converting to self-funded or alternative funded arrangements. In addition, about a quarter of our small group (SG) elected to renew early into their non-metaled products, with allowed claims that are approximately 3% lower than those who did not renew early. The combined impact is estimated to bring the pool&rsquo;s allowed claims of $394 to $406 or a 3% increase.b. Changes in Demographics: Comparing the CFI member-level average age as of December 31, 2012 to March 31, 2014, the change has been plus 0.6 years from 34.9 to 35.6. Age factors will account for a portion of the corresponding increase in claims cost but not all of it. We find this to be true because the age curve spread is 3 to 1 whereas data indicates that it should be higher. We believe that most accurate spread is somewhere in between the prior, pre-ACA 2.55 of MD Small Group Reform and the 4.5 to 1 spread for the Individual Non-Medigap, medically underwritten market but higher than 3.0. We have therefore adjusted expected claims costs accordingly in the experience period (EP) index rate projection in the other category.c. Trend Factors (Cost over Utilization): The proposed trend of 6.8% is a reduction of 270 basis points from 2014&rsquo;s 9.5%.d. Projected Loss Ratio: Our projected NAIC DICR for MLR purposes is 81.2%, above the 80.0% minimum of Public Health Service Act (PHSA) 218.3.	CHANGES IN MEDICAL SERVICE COSTS: The experience period index rate is a key component driving the renewal. Last year&rsquo;s implicit 2013 index rate was $366 ($334 x trend of 9.5%).4.	CHANGES IN BENEFITS: For CareFirst&rsquo;s small group offerings in Maryland, we are adding 2 new benefits to our portfolio bringing the total number of unique plans from 42 to 44&ndash; 4 Bronze, 15 Silver (includes a new HMO $1,000 deductible plan), 10 Gold (including a new HMO BlueAdvantage $500 deductible plan) and 15 Platinum. We have recalculated the costs of Essential Health Benefits (EHB) as well as Non-EHBs.a. Per COMAR 31.10.39 Utilization Review of Treatment for Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders, Bulletin 14-07 and due to the passage of SB 759 HB 783, Coverage for Autism Spectrum Disorders, we have calculated an increase in claims of $5 per member per month (PMPM) for 2015. This is largely for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) treatments and is a state-mandated EHB benefit. The $5 PMPM is derived from an incidence assumption of 1 in 68 children ages 1-21, an uptake rate of 1 in 3 and an intensity rate of $40,000 to $95,000 per year depending on age.b. Other adjustment were made for pediatric dental, mandatory generics, a new hepatitis C prescription drug, Sovaldi, and maternity.c. Other Adjustments: CareFirst (CF) is proposing to introduce an incentive program (IP) whereby members can earn medical expense debit cards of as much as $250 annually, for an individual ($650 for a family). The cards must be utilized for qualified medical expenses such as deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket costs. The scope includes all benefit plans within CF&rsquo;s portfolio, On and Off the Exchange. This is being done in a revenue-neutral way. That is, the cost to CF of the incentive payments was chosen such that they match the expected savings to CF from more efficacious health care delivery. HealthyBlue (HB) was first launched effective October 1, 2010 with the objective of motivating and rewarding greater engagement by the member in his or her health, improved wellness and prevention and better provider coordination and quality. As we sought to respond to feedback about HB, subsequent versions were released on January 1, 2012 and October 1, 2012. This IP represents an evolution of the HB concept. Further, it joins the tenets of HB with our Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) program which was launched on January, 2011.Our aim is that this IP will improve our members&rsquo; health.d. Included are decreases to claims costs for 1) a change in our Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) in 2014 and 2) a reduction in our fee schedule for out-of-network (OON) utilization for HMO-based products that have an OON option (a.k.a., NP3).e. Membership Projections: We had projected 82% of enrollment in HMO-based plans as of December 31, 2014 in our 2014 filings. Actual data as of April 10, 2014 indicates that HMO comprises 84% of our CFI members. YTD enrollment also indicates more Bronze and Silver (67% versus 57%) and less Gold (17% versus 25%). We incorporated both of these facts in projecting December 31, 2015 enrollment.f. Also, per HB 0625, oral chemotherapy coverage has been mandated. The cost of reducing cost shares to not exceed those of intravenous chemotherapy has been deemed negligible.g. Diabetic supplies have been moved to $0 copays. The deductible applies for H.S.A. plans but not for non-H.S.A.s with negligible price impact.h. Retail Clinics such as urgent care centers will have reduced copays to match the PCP rather than specialist copay with negligible price impact.5.

These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care.  These actions include:&bull;	Developing new agreements, arrangements, and  partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull;	Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Aetna Navigator, My Online Services, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services. Additionally, Aetna&rsquo;s Plan for Your Health website aims to educate all consumers, not just Aetna members, on how to take advantage of their health care benefits.",Review Complete,21.46,99129IL004,Aetna Health Maintenance Organization,Aetna Health Inc.

The company has requested approval for an overall rate increase of 11.6%, to be effective January 1, 2015. The main drivers of the rate increase are changes in morbidity and trend.In support of their request, HIC has provided premium rates, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template, a Part II Preliminary Justification of Rate Increase and a Part III Actuarial Memorandum. The Actuarial Memorandum included, inter alia, actuarial assumptions, anticipated loss ratios, other information required by the ACA and appropriate actuarial certifications.INS has reviewed the submission in its entirety. However, INS has given special consideration in its review to the details of the Company&rsquo;s Part III Actuarial Memorandum, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template and the characteristics of the rating elements subject to the Federal regulations prescribed in 45CFR Part 147 paragraph 147.102.  Based on that review, INS has come to the following key conclusions:URRT Section 1 Experience Period Data&bull;	Earned premiums, incurred claims, allowed claims and index rate per member per month (PMPM) for the experience period, January 2013 through December 2013, appear normal&bull;	The completion method used to determine estimated incurred claims and allowed claims is consistent with accepted actuarial methods&bull;	Member months for the Experience Period, 125,768, is expected to increase to 161,017 for the Projection Period. The company based its projection on in-force persistency, anticipated market growth and the competitiveness of its product. Based on the narrative provided by the company, the projection appears reasonable.URRT Section II Allowed Claims, PMPM Basis&bull;	Benefit Category descriptions closely follow the preferred descriptions of the URRT instructions&bull;	The utilization per 1,000 and the average cost/service factors by benefit category for the Experience Period appear to be average for the Small Group market&bull;	The total allowed PMPM claim cost of $340.10 (Section II) matches the index rate of $340.00 (Section I) for the experience period (difference due to rounding)&bull;	The overall annual Trend assumption of 6.2% was developed from both the company&rsquo;s own small group experience. Based on the narrative provided in the Actuarial Memorandum, the trend assumption appears to be reasonable.&bull;	HIC used a&lsquo;Population Risk Morbidity&rsquo; factor of 1.076 to project their underlying experience. Based on the narrative and chart provided by the company, INS believes the 1.076 Morbidity factor to be reasonable&bull;	The&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factor used by HIC to project their underlying experience was set to 1.105. The main drivers behind this factor were:1.	Additional benefits to meet the Essential Health Benefit (EHB) guidelines2.	Induced utilization3.	Changes in demographicsBased on the narrative and chart provided by the company, INS believes the 1.105&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factor to be reasonable.URRT Section II Credibility Manual&bull;	Because HIC considers its experience data to be 100% credible, the company did not create a Credibility Manual.URRT Section III Projected Experience&bull;	HIC considers 120,000 member months of experience to be 100% credible. Because it had over 125,000 member months during the Experience Period, the experience data is considered 100% credible. INS believes this to be reasonable&bull;	The method used to determine the&lsquo;Paid to Allowed Average Factor in the Projection Period&rsquo; of 71.0% is actuarially acceptable and such average factor is consistent with both the Experience Period data and the&lsquo;paid to allowed&rsquo; ratios at the plan level&bull;	Companies are allowed to make a Risk Adjustment in developing its incurred claims on the URRT. Risk adjustment calculates a risk score for each plan participant, based upon age, sex and diagnosis. This is used to calculate the company&rsquo;s Plan average risk score. If the Plan average risk score is higher than the average risk score for the state, the Company will receive payment for having a higher risk population. Because HIC anticipates its market level risk scores to be consistent with the Tennessee market, its Risk Adjustment is 0. However, due to changes in the URRT instructions for 2015, the $.08 Risk Adjustment Fee appears as -.08 on the Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM line in Worksheet 1, Section III of the URRT&bull;	HIC has an expectant gross reinsurance recovery of zero, since small group business does not participate in the reinsurance program. Please note, however, that the URRT correctly shows the reinsurance fee that small group insurers must pay&bull;	The combined&lsquo;Administrative Expense Load&rsquo;,&lsquo;Profit&amp; Risk Load&rsquo; and&lsquo;Taxes&amp; Fees&rsquo; appear average for the Small Group market&bull;	The&lsquo;Index Rate for Projection Period&rsquo; of $467.75 differs from the&lsquo;Projected Allowed Experience Claims PMPM&rsquo; of $456.36. This is because the 1st quarter index rate, which is equal to $456.36, is adjusted for quarterly trend throughout the year. It should be noted that the company trended its 2015 Index Values at an annualized interest rate of 7.2%.Part III Actuarial Memorandum&bull;	The Company&rsquo;s Actuarial Memorandum satisfies the Part III Actuarial Memorandum and Certification Instructions dated March 20, 2014 and issued by the Department of Health and Human Services&bull;	The company calculated their projected medical loss ratio (MLR) to be 85.7%. The calculation appears to be actuarially reasonable&bull;	The company&rsquo;s methodology used to derive the Market Adjusted Index Rate, Plan Adjusted Index Rates, Consumer Adjusted Index Rates and Calibration Factors is consistent with accepted actuarial methods&bull;	The Company&rsquo;s analysis and calculation of Actuarial Values comply with guidance provided in the PPACA, HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2015, Final Rule, 79 FR 13743 (March11, 2014)&bull;	There were no&lsquo;Warning Alerts&rsquo; in Worksheet 2 of the URRT&bull;	The Actuarial Memorandum included the required actuarial certifications.Federal regulations prescribed in 45CFR Part 147 paragraph 147.102&bull;	All premium rates vary only with respect to allowable rating factors: [1] family composition, [2] age and [3] geographic area&bull;	Relating to the family rating and in accordance with the subject Federal regulation, the premium calculation follows a member-level build up approach which is capped such that no more than the three oldest covered children under the age 21 can be taken into account when determining the total family premium&bull;	Relating to the premium age curve and in accordance with the subject Federal regulation, the premium variation between the youngest and the oldest adult individuals between the ages of 21-64 does not exceed a ratio of 3:1 (and adheres to the Health and Human Services&rsquo; Default Standard Age Curve)&bull;	A fourth allowable rating factor, tobacco usage, was not used by HIC in its pricing.Miscellaneous Items&bull;	HIC is offering 124 Small Group plans&ndash; 21 Gold, 82 Silver and 21Bronze&bull;	Pediatric dental benefits are automatically included in all of HIC&rsquo;s Small Group plans&bull;	Regarding the Consumer Adjusted Index Rates found in the Rate Data Template, INS confirmed that:1.	Although the URRT does not demonstrate the process used by HIC to develop its rates, the AV Pricing Values were used in developing each plan&rsquo;s proposed premium rates.

180734,82120,Individual,ST,01/01/2014,false,05/07/2013,10/22/2013,Not Unreasonable,"INS Consultants, Inc. (INS) has reviewed the Individual PPO filing of Humana Insurance Company (HIC).This is a new rate filing that was submitted on June 3, 2013. The filing is subject to the requirements of Tennessee Regulations and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The premium rates are to be effective from January 1, 2014.After a review of the actuarial memorandum and Unified Rate Review Template (URRT) filed in support of the subject rate filing, INS identified on June 28, 2013 several matters that required additional clarification. On July 16, 2013, HIC provided clarification that responded to the questions raised by INS.In support of their request, HIC has provided historical experience, premium rates, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template and a Part III Actuarial Memorandum. The actuarial memorandum included, inter alia, actuarial assumptions, anticipated loss ratios, other information required by the ACA and appropriate actuarial certifications.INS has reviewed the submission in its entirety. However, INS has given special consideration in its review to the details of the Company&rsquo;s Part III Actuarial Memorandum, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template and the characteristics of the rating elements subject to the Federal regulations prescribed in 45CFR Part 147 paragraph 147.102. Based on that review, INS has come to the following key conclusionsURRT Section 1 Experience Period Data&bull; Although limited, earned premiums, incurred claim, allowed claims and index rate PMPM for the experience period, January 2012 through December 2012, appear reasonable for the individual market,&bull; The completion method used to determine estimated incurred claims and allowed claims is consistent with accepted actuarial methods:&bull; The ratio of incurred claims to allowed claims for the experience period (58.5%) and the projection period (60.3%) are closely consistent.&bull; Member months for the experience period (99,879) grows significantly to (558,093) for projection period. This growth projection relies on the Company&rsquo;s assumptions that the individual market will increase significantly.URRT Section II Allowed Claims, PMPM Basis&bull; Benefit Category descriptions closely follow the preferred descriptions of the URRT instructions,&bull; The utilization per 1000 and the average cost/service factors by benefit category appear to be reasonable for the individual market,&bull; The total allowed PMPM claim cost of $174.64 matches the average index rate of $174.64 for the experience period,&bull; Relating to the expected changes in the morbidity of the population insured, HIC provided the underlying assumptions which were used to develop these changes. The methods and assumptions used to determine the expected 52% risk pool change appear actuarially reasonable and consistent with actuarial methods.&bull; Relating to the&ldquo;other&rdquo; adjustments attributable to expected changes in benefits (4.2%), changes in demographics (-0.1%) and new networks impact (-5.7%), the methods and assumptions used to determine the adjustment of -1.9% appears actuarially reasonable and consistent with actuarial methods.&bull; Relating to the expected annualized trend factors, these factors reflect the pool experience of Humana&rsquo;s Individual Commercial block of business. Based on our review, the methods and assumptions used to determine the specific benefit category trend factors ranging from 0% to 20.6% appear actuarially reasonable and consistent with actuarial methods,URRT Section II Credibility Manual&bull; The Company&rsquo;s credibility manual is based on Humana&rsquo;s nationwide experience for the 2012 experience adjusted to reflect the impact of morbidity differences, the impact of EHB and demographic changes. Further, the credibility manual includes an adjustment to reflect the credibility of Tennessee Humana Insurance company experience. Based on our review, the assumptions and methods relating to these adjustments appear actuarially reasonable.&bull; Based on our review of the HIC response information, the credibility manual&ldquo;utilization per 100&rdquo; and&ldquo;average cost/service&rdquo; figures appear actuarially reasonable.URRT Section III Projected Experience&bull; The method and formula used to assign a credibility ratio of 46.95% to the experience period data and 53.05% to the credibility manual data is consistent with accepted actuarial practices.&bull; The method used to determine the&ldquo;paid to allowed average factor in the projection period&rdquo; of 60.3% is actuarially acceptable and such average factor is consistent with&ldquo;paid to allowed&rdquo; ratios at the plan level.&bull; The method used to determine the&ldquo;projected risk adjustments PMPM&rdquo; of $13.61 follows the methodology outlined in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) , HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters of 2014, Final Rule, 78 FR 15410 (March 13, 2013).&bull; The assumption and method used to determine the&ldquo;projected ACA reinsurance recoveries, net of reinsurance premium, PMPM&rdquo; of $19.47 appear reasonable and consistent with accepted actuarial practice.&bull; Administrative Expense Load, Profit and Risk Load, and Taxes and Fees appear reasonable for the individual market.&bull; The&ldquo;index rate for projection period&rdquo; of $311.65 is calculated as the 2014 allowed claims PMPM for the credibility adjusted pool (there are no benefits in excess of EHB for 2014).Part III Actuarial Memorandum&bull; The Company&rsquo;s actuarial memorandum satisfies the Part III Actuarial Memorandum and Certification Instructions dated March 18, 2013 and issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.&bull; The company&rsquo;s calculation of the projected medical loss ratio of at least 80.0% is actuarially reasonable.&bull; The company&rsquo;s methodology used to derive plan specific index rates is consistent with accepted actuarial methods.&bull; The Company&rsquo;s analysis and calculation of Actuarial Values comply with guidance provided in the PPACA, Standards Related to Essential Health Benefits, Actuarial Value, and Accreditation, Final Rule, 78 FR 12834(February 25, 2013).&bull; Regarding membership projections, the assumptions underlying the Company&rsquo;s expectation of a significant increase in membership appear actuarially reasonable.&bull; The Company has responded to the indicated&ldquo;warning alerts&rdquo;&bull; The actuarial memorandum includes the required actuarial certifications.&bull; The opining actuary has qualified his opinion by disclosing the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template does not demonstrate the process used by HIC to develop rates, but rather represents information required by Federal regulation to be provided in support of the review of rate increase, for certification of qualified health plans for federally facilitated exchanges, and for certification that the index rate is developed in accordance with Federal regulation and used consistently and only adjusted by the allowable modifiers.Federal regulations prescribed in 45CFR Part 147 paragraph 147.102&bull; All premium rates vary only with respect to the allowable rating factors (1) family composition, (2) age, (3) tobacco use, and (4) geographic area.&bull; Relating to the family rating and in accordance with the subject Federal regulation, the premium calculation follows a member-level build up approach which is capped such that no more than the three oldest covered children under the age 21 can be taken into account when determining the total family premium.&bull; Relating to the premium age curve and in accordance with the subject Federal regulation, the premium variation between the youngest and the oldest adult individuals between the ages of 21-64 does not exceed a ratio of 3:1.&bull; Relating to the premium adjustment for tobacco use and in accordance with the subject Federal regulation, the premium rates vary by tobacco usage, but not by more than a 1.5:1 ratio.Based on INS&rsquo;s review and on the certifying statements of HIC&rsquo;s opining actuary, INS suggests that the subject filing is compliant with Tennessee and PPACA regulations.

These trend factors affect health insurance premiums, which can mean a premium rate increase to cover costs.  Some of the key health care cost trends that have affected this year&rsquo;s rate actions include:-Increasing Cost of Medical Services&ndash; Annual increases in reimbursement rates to health care providers&ndash; such as hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical companies.-Increased Utilization&ndash; The number of office visits and other services continues to grow.  In addition, total health care spending will vary by the intensity of care and use of different types of health services. Patients who are sicker generally have a higher intensity of health care utilization. The price of care can be affected by the use of expensive procedures such as surgery vs. simply monitoring or providing medications.-Higher Costs from Deductible Leveraging&ndash; Health care costs continue to rise every year, while deductibles and copayments remain the same.  As a result, a greater percentage of health care costs need to be covered by health insurance premiums each year.-Cost shifting from the public to the private sector&ndash; Reimbursements from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to hospitals are no longer covering all of the cost of care.  The cost difference is being shifted to private health plans. Additionally, Medicare and Medicaid rates to hospitals are expected to decline due to the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on Medicare and the effect of the recession on Medicaid.  A rate increase paid by Medicaid to hospitals is often below the actual cost increase hospitals will experience.-Impact of New Technology - Improvements to medical technology and clinical practice require use of more expensive services - leading to increased health care spending and utilization.-Underwriting Wear Off&ndash; The variation by policy duration in individual medical insurance claims, where claims are higher at later policy durations as more time has elapsed since initial underwriting.Changes in BenefitsThere have been no premium changes due to benefit changes in this filing.Administrative CostsGolden Rule Insurance Company works to directly control administrative expenses by adopting better processes and technology, and through the development of programs and innovations that make health care more affordable. We have led the marketplace by introducing key innovations that make health care services more accessible and affordable for customers, improve the quality and coordination of health care services, and help individuals and their physicians make more informed health care decisions.Additionally, Golden Rule indirectly controls medical cost payments by using appropriate payment structures with providers and facilities. Golden Rule&rsquo;s goal is to control costs, maximize efficiency, and work closely with physicians and providers to obtain the best value and coverage.In addition, increases in State and Federal government imposed taxation and fees are another significant factor that impacts health care spending.These fees include new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) taxes and fees which will increase health insurance costs and need to be reflected in premium.  The two largest cost impacts both take effect with calendar year 2014 earned premiums:-Insurer Fee: UnitedHealthcare (parent company of Golden Rule) estimates 2014 premium will need to be increased by 1.625% to cover this fee and the associated additional federal income tax.-Reinsurance Fee: UnitedHealthcare estimates 2014 premium will need to be increased by 2.4%.A review of the current Golden Rule premium rate indicates that the rate is not sufficient to cover the projected benefit and administrative costs. The requested rate increase is anticipated to be sufficient to cover the projected benefit and administrative costs over the period beginning January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014.",Review Complete,18.00,51984WI016,Gen 26 - Copay Select,Golden Rule Insurance Company,Wisconsin,WI,Annual,18.00,18.00,RC

The average increase will be approximately 18% and will vary somewhat by plan due to the way medical inflation is amplified or dampened by plan parameters such as deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums.2) Key Drivers of IncreaseThe main drivers of the requested 18% rate increase are medical inflation (approximately 8%), experience worse than that expected in previous pricing (approximately 10%), deductible leveraging (approximately 2%) and plan indexing (approximately -1%, more detail in the next section).Analysis of this block of business indicated a 10% increase for experience worse than expected. Due to the low volume of data available and in order to reduce the impact to policyholders, this was limited to 7.5%.3) Change in BenefitsAll MIC long-term contracts include a provision for indexing of deductibles and out-of-pocket (OOP) maximums in order to observe Federal HSA indexing requirements for HSA compatible plans and to minimize the need for future rate increases on the remainder of the long-term portfolio.  The rate increase includes approximately -1% for the indexing of deductible and out-of-pocket maximums.No other benefit changes are being made.3) Administrative Costs and Anticipated ProfitsThe main drivers of our administrative expenses are employee salaries and benefits, agent commissions, claim processing, and premium taxes, licenses and fees.

This is an increase of $455.34 from the average current rate.  There are estimated to be 8 customers impacted by this rate increase over the course of next year.The average increase a customer will see is 89%, and the percentage increase will vary from -16.8% to 173.8% by customer. The rate increase is mostly driven by changes that had to be made to ensure compliance with ACA regulations. The average increase a customer will see also includes the impact of trend.Currently rates for the Individual Conversion Plans in Nevada do not vary by age. However, rates are being updated to ensure compliance with ACA regulations which includes being compliant with the federally designated age slope. Therefore, on average, younger individuals would expect to see rate decreases while older individuals are expected to see rate increases versus the current rates. Cigna's current membership on these plans consists mainly of older members, leading to the large average rate increase.  As outlined in the accompanying actuarial memorandum, Cigna would expect a rate decrease of 4.9% if the same rate changes had been applied to a population with a standard age distribution.Financial Experience of Connecticut General Life Insurance Company Individual Conversion Products:For the experience period, Cigna only had one member on its Nevada Individual conversion plan, and does not believe its past experience to be credible.How Legally Required Benefit Changes contribute to the rate increase:Benefit changes in order to comply with ACA regulations have contributed 16% of the rate increase.

Financial Experience of the ProductThe products in this filing were first launched on 1-1-14, and therefore have no experience in the 2013 experience period.    The closed non-grandfathered products from 2013, upon which these rates were based, had total premiums and allowed claims for the incurred period of 1-1-13 through 12-31-13 of $27,256,197 and $34,336,811.The primary factors driving this proposed change in premium rates are:a) Projected significant increase in membership volumes with average morbidities higher than 2014.  CareFirst estimates a morbidity risk factor of 1.35 for 2015.    The morbidity risk factor projections are based upon the model that supported CareFirst&rsquo;s 2014 rate filings.  The model compares known and estimated allowed claims costs per member per month (PMPM) for 2013 to project the costs of various categories of the estimated 2015 membership.b) An aging of the pool of members.

(NAIC code number 55107) has applied to the Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services to adjust premium rates for its community-rated small group and individual qualified health plans.I. OVERVIEWThe rates being sought contain a zero percent operating margin for the health plan despite the health plan reporting operating losses in 2013 and a forecasted significant operating loss in 2014. The proposed rate adjustment is based on the need to adjust prospectively from the state&rsquo;s reduction of rates by 6.3% on small group qualified health plans and by 4.0% on individual qualified health plans for 2014, an increasing medical cost trend, and changes in the health insurance market driven by federal and state actions. Other contributing factors for the proposed 2015 rate adjustment include increases in fees, taxes and added coverage for new mandated benefits.Excellus Health Plan and related companies (EHP) provide health insurance and administrative services for about 1.8 million upstate New Yorkers in 39 counties. The proposed premium rates affect about 182,000 members or 10% of the health plan&rsquo;s total membership. Its proposed rates are subject to review by the New York Department of Financial Services pursuant to section 4308c of the New York Insurance Law. The Department may approve the proposed rate increase as requested, modify the proposed rate increase, or disapprove the proposed rate increase in its entirety. The determination by the Department shall be supported by sound actuarial assumptions and methods.The rate application will be filed with the Department on or about June 13, 2014. The actual rate increases approved by the Department will be communicated to the impacted parties at least 60 days prior to the date the new rate is implemented for the subscriber. EHP policyholders with renewal dates during 2015 would, if approved, receive the indicated rate adjustments on their next anniversary date on or after January 1, 2015.Excellus Health Plan is required by New York State law to develop rates that assume that at least 82% of premium revenue will be spent on health care costs in the direct pay market along with small groups, be actuarially sound, cover all claim costs, and provide a contribution to ensure adequate reserves. The percent of premium attributable to claims is referred to as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).Excellus Health Plan's MLR has been and continues to exceed the statutory minimums. In 2013, the MLR for Excellus Health Plan was 94.2% for individual direct pay and 91.0% for small groups. Under new reporting requirements for 2014, the three-year cumulative MLR is 94.4% for individual direct pay and 91.5% for small group qualified health plans. With the proposed rate adjustments, Excellus Health Plan's MLRs would remain well above the minimum levels. In the event the MLR falls below the required minimum, the health plan refunds any difference to policyholders.Periodic rate adjustments are necessary to secure the ability of Excellus Health Plan, or any insurer, to produce sufficient revenue and surplus for reserves to assure continued coverage and claim payments both for current health care needs, and potential catastrophic cost situations. Excellus Health Plan's reserves vary from year to year based on actual health care costs incurred. As of Dec. 31, 2013, the health plan had reserves equivalent to 2.5 months of claims and operating expense, and more than the minimum required by New York State law. These reserves are the insurance that assures payment even when costs run higher than anticipated, or emergencies or disasters occur, and should not be used as an alternative fund to temporarily reduce rate adjustments.In filing its rate application, Excellus Health Plan is sensitive to the fact that individuals and small businesses struggle to afford higher premiums. However, it is clear that an increase in premiums is necessary to assure the continued operations of the Plan and the viability of its product offerings. Because EHP already has a high MLR, failure to approve these rates would only lead to the need for even greater rate increases in the future as claim costs would eventually exceed premiums collected.II. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASEEscalating health care costsThe cost of health care services, equipment and products continues to be the primary reason for rate increases.Trend is a very important consideration in determining the need for a premium rate adjustment. Upstate New York is not immune to national trends in health care costs given our state&rsquo;s population and demographics. Industry experts such as Segal Consulting and Buck Consultants are forecasting a 7.2-10.4% medical benefit trend nationwide for 2014. EHP is forecasting an overall medical benefit trend factor for its commercial fully insured business of 6.8% for 2014-2015. The trend forecast takes into account projected increases in costs attributed to what Excellus Health Plan pays out in claims expenses for hospital inpatient and outpatient care, professional services, pharmacy benefits and other goods and services. The health plan&rsquo;s anticipated changes in medical benefit spending are summarized as follows:Hospital inpatient, 6.9%Hospital outpatient, 6.4%Professional services, 4.5%Pharmacy, 10.6%Other medical goods and services, 7.5%These trends do not include adjustments to base rates for previous rate increases that were insufficient to cover claims and operating expenses for some plan options.Health care costs for each of those benefit components take into account the compounding effects of both the price of the goods or services provided as well as the quantity of the goods and services consumed.The impact that each trend has to the overall cost of coverage is related to proportionate size of the benefit component. For example, overall spending would rise faster as a result of a 5% increase in professional services versus a 5% increase in drug costs because professional services represents a larger share of medical benefit spending.III. NEW YORK TAXES AND ASSESSMENTSInsurance taxes are built into the costs of health coverage. New Yorkers who voluntarily purchase private health insurance coverage paid more than $4 billion in state health taxes in 2011, according to an analysis by the New York State Conference of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans.New York&rsquo;s Health Care Reform Act of 1996 (HCRA) created two surcharges on health insurance and an additional tax is imposed under Section 206 (formerly Section 332) of the state Insurance Law.The covered lives assessment is an annual flat surcharge or tax on every person who has insurance coverage in the state. Health plans are assessed on the basis of the number of people they cover with individual and family rates that vary depending on the residence of the insured. Among upstate regions defined by the state, the annual covered lives assessment rates in 2014 that impact Excellus Health Plan members are as follows:Per Certificate Per Year by region (Individual : Family)Western: $39.40: $130.03Rochester: $105.72: $348.87Central: $55.59: $183.46Utica-Watertown: $8.54: $28.17Northeastern: $39.94: $131.79The second surcharge created by the 1996 Health Care Reform Act is collected from health plans in the form of a sales tax on many hospital-related services. The surcharge is applied to both self-insured and fully insured plans. Beginning at 8.18% in 1997, the surcharge is now at 9.63%.The third levy, the Section 206 assessment, was originally established to finance New York State Department of Insurance operations but its funding purposes have expanded beyond that purpose. The assessments apply to all licensed insurers in the state (e.g. life, property and casualty, and health), and are based on New York premiums.In total, the above New York taxes and assessments including Section 206 aggregated to nearly 6% of the 2015 small group and individual qualified health plans&rsquo; premium.IV. FEDERAL TAXES, MANDATES AND ADJUSTMENTSAnnual fee on health insurance providers:Beginning in 2014, this fee is based on each health insurance company&rsquo;s market share of net premiums written, adjusted for size and corporate structure.The federal law requires the total fee on nationwide health insurance providers to be collected is:$8 billion in 2014,$11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016,$13.9 billion in 2017, and$14.3 billion in 2018.After 2018, the fee is expected to collect $14.3 billion, indexed to the rate of growth in premiums.Each year, the calculation will be based on the market share of each assessed plan and will change based on the number of companies in the insured market. Under this fee provision, a health plan could incur financial losses but would still be subject to the market share fee.For EHP, this fee increase represents a 1.2% increase to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans for 2015.Risk Adjustment Program:The risk adjustment program is a permanent provision that applies to both the individual and small group insurance market. This federal program assesses a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and uses the revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members.A fee of $0.96 per member per year is collected to fund the risk adjustment program. For EHP, this program reduces small group qualified health plans&rsquo; premiums by about 1.5%. For 2015, this program has no impact on the premium of individual direct pay qualified health plans.Transitional reinsurance program for the individual market:The federal law created a temporary reinsurance program that is to collect nationwide:$10 billion in 2014,$6 billion in 2015, and$4 billion in 2016.Additionally, a separate contribution is to be deposited into the U.S. Treasury that will total $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016.The contribution rate is to be based on a $44 national per capita yearly amount in 2015. All insurers and self- insured group health plans are required to contribute on behalf of all group health plans and health insurance coverage they provide. For EHP, this fee represents about 1% of premium but it is about 40% less than last year resulting in a 0.5% decrease to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans in 2015.For the individual qualified health plans, the federal government established reinsurance for excessive claims. The amount of money being distributed in 2014 is being reduced in 2015. At the same time, this reduction will require a 3.8% premium increase for individual qualified health plans.Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) fee:The federal law created the PCORI to help stakeholders make informed health decisions by advancing the quality and relevance of evidence-based medicine through the use of comparative clinical effectiveness research findings. The fee is set at $2 per year multiplied by the average number of lives covered under the plan for plan years ending before October 1, 2014. And, for plan years ending on or after October 1, 2014, the fee increases based on the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures.Federal mental health mandateThe federal requirements for coverage of mental health parity require a 0.2% increase to current premium to pay for required benefits in 2015.V. OPERATING EXPENSE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTSA portion of what is reported to the state as administrative expenses is attributed to what Federal Health Reform considers quality improvement expenses, meaning the federal government recognizes that these represent costs that lead to overall improvements in health care versus simply a routine business expense, and as a result will be considered a medical benefit expense for purposes of federal MLR calculations.Those quality improvement expenses include such items as:-Improvements in health outcomes brought about by case management and disease management programs,-Actions taken to help prevent hospital readmissions through such things as discharge planning and counseling,-Wellness and community health promotional activities, and-Health information technology that is used to help measure clinical effectiveness and predictive modeling.The proposed rates will more accurately reflect the true operating expense of administering the federal Health Care Reform legislation through the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange. The changes in the health insurance market required building and implementing an entirely new sales channel from what had primarily been a business-to-business marketplace.This required:-The implementation of a new sales call center that saw extended open enrollment deadlines in 2014,-The hiring of additional staff,-Increased direct-to-consumer communication costs to educate consumers about new products and how to access those products, and-The building and implementation of new products, new infrastructure for the continued improvements and changes to the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange and for the implementation of additional mandates for the federal Health Care Reform.Operating expenses - including quality improvement initiatives but excluding federal and state taxes, fees and assessments, and broker commissions - represent 8.7% of premium in small group qualified health plans and 8.4% in individual qualified health plans.VI. REGULATION 146Regulation 146 was a market stabilization mechanism for the individual and small group pools that was in effect prior to the adoption of the ACA. Similar to the ACA Risk Adjustment program, Reg. 146 attempted to equalize the risk within the small group and individual markets by assessing a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and used this revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members. Because of the redundancy with the new risk adjustment program, Reg. 146 is being phased out. The Department of Financial Services is requiring plans to distribute all outstanding compensations through premium adjustments in 2015 and 2016. This distribution plan results in a reduction in the small group qualified health plan premium of 0.3% and in individual premium of about 1%.",Review Complete,12.20,78124NY099,Excellus PPO Hybrid,"Excellus Health Plan, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Quarterly,16.35,16.35,RC

(NAIC code number 55107) has applied to the Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services to adjust premium rates for its community-rated small group and individual qualified health plans.I. OVERVIEWThe rates being sought contain a zero percent operating margin for the health plan despite the health plan reporting operating losses in 2013 and a forecasted significant operating loss in 2014. The proposed rate adjustment is based on the need to adjust prospectively from the state&rsquo;s reduction of rates by 6.3% on small group qualified health plans and by 4.0% on individual qualified health plans for 2014, an increasing medical cost trend, and changes in the health insurance market driven by federal and state actions. Other contributing factors for the proposed 2015 rate adjustment include increases in fees, taxes and added coverage for new mandated benefits.Excellus Health Plan and related companies (EHP) provide health insurance and administrative services for about 1.8 million upstate New Yorkers in 39 counties. The proposed premium rates affect about 182,000 members or 10% of the health plan&rsquo;s total membership. Its proposed rates are subject to review by the New York Department of Financial Services pursuant to section 4308c of the New York Insurance Law. The Department may approve the proposed rate increase as requested, modify the proposed rate increase, or disapprove the proposed rate increase in its entirety. The determination by the Department shall be supported by sound actuarial assumptions and methods.The rate application will be filed with the Department on or about June 13, 2014. The actual rate increases approved by the Department will be communicated to the impacted parties at least 60 days prior to the date the new rate is implemented for the subscriber. EHP policyholders with renewal dates during 2015 would, if approved, receive the indicated rate adjustments on their next anniversary date on or after January 1, 2015.Excellus Health Plan is required by New York State law to develop rates that assume that at least 82% of premium revenue will be spent on health care costs in the direct pay market along with small groups, be actuarially sound, cover all claim costs, and provide a contribution to ensure adequate reserves. The percent of premium attributable to claims is referred to as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).Excellus Health Plan's MLR has been and continues to exceed the statutory minimums. In 2013, the MLR for Excellus Health Plan was 94.2% for individual direct pay and 91.0% for small groups. Under new reporting requirements for 2014, the three-year cumulative MLR is 94.4% for individual direct pay and 91.5% for small group qualified health plans. With the proposed rate adjustments, Excellus Health Plan's MLRs would remain well above the minimum levels. In the event the MLR falls below the required minimum, the health plan refunds any difference to policyholders.Periodic rate adjustments are necessary to secure the ability of Excellus Health Plan, or any insurer, to produce sufficient revenue and surplus for reserves to assure continued coverage and claim payments both for current health care needs, and potential catastrophic cost situations. Excellus Health Plan's reserves vary from year to year based on actual health care costs incurred. As of Dec. 31, 2013, the health plan had reserves equivalent to 2.5 months of claims and operating expense, and more than the minimum required by New York State law. These reserves are the insurance that assures payment even when costs run higher than anticipated, or emergencies or disasters occur, and should not be used as an alternative fund to temporarily reduce rate adjustments.In filing its rate application, Excellus Health Plan is sensitive to the fact that individuals and small businesses struggle to afford higher premiums. However, it is clear that an increase in premiums is necessary to assure the continued operations of the Plan and the viability of its product offerings. Because EHP already has a high MLR, failure to approve these rates would only lead to the need for even greater rate increases in the future as claim costs would eventually exceed premiums collected.II. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASEEscalating health care costsThe cost of health care services, equipment and products continues to be the primary reason for rate increases.Trend is a very important consideration in determining the need for a premium rate adjustment. Upstate New York is not immune to national trends in health care costs given our state&rsquo;s population and demographics. Industry experts such as Segal Consulting and Buck Consultants are forecasting a 7.2-10.4% medical benefit trend nationwide for 2014. EHP is forecasting an overall medical benefit trend factor for its commercial fully insured business of 6.8% for 2014-2015. The trend forecast takes into account projected increases in costs attributed to what Excellus Health Plan pays out in claims expenses for hospital inpatient and outpatient care, professional services, pharmacy benefits and other goods and services. The health plan&rsquo;s anticipated changes in medical benefit spending are summarized as follows:Hospital inpatient, 6.9%Hospital outpatient, 6.4%Professional services, 4.5%Pharmacy, 10.6%Other medical goods and services, 7.5%These trends do not include adjustments to base rates for previous rate increases that were insufficient to cover claims and operating expenses for some plan options.Health care costs for each of those benefit components take into account the compounding effects of both the price of the goods or services provided as well as the quantity of the goods and services consumed.The impact that each trend has to the overall cost of coverage is related to proportionate size of the benefit component. For example, overall spending would rise faster as a result of a 5% increase in professional services versus a 5% increase in drug costs because professional services represents a larger share of medical benefit spending.III. NEW YORK TAXES AND ASSESSMENTSInsurance taxes are built into the costs of health coverage. New Yorkers who voluntarily purchase private health insurance coverage paid more than $4 billion in state health taxes in 2011, according to an analysis by the New York State Conference of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans.New York&rsquo;s Health Care Reform Act of 1996 (HCRA) created two surcharges on health insurance and an additional tax is imposed under Section 206 (formerly Section 332) of the state Insurance Law.The covered lives assessment is an annual flat surcharge or tax on every person who has insurance coverage in the state. Health plans are assessed on the basis of the number of people they cover with individual and family rates that vary depending on the residence of the insured. Among upstate regions defined by the state, the annual covered lives assessment rates in 2014 that impact Excellus Health Plan members are as follows:Per Certificate Per Year by region (Individual : Family)Western: $39.40: $130.03Rochester: $105.72: $348.87Central: $55.59: $183.46Utica-Watertown: $8.54: $28.17Northeastern: $39.94: $131.79The second surcharge created by the 1996 Health Care Reform Act is collected from health plans in the form of a sales tax on many hospital-related services. The surcharge is applied to both self-insured and fully insured plans. Beginning at 8.18% in 1997, the surcharge is now at 9.63%.The third levy, the Section 206 assessment, was originally established to finance New York State Department of Insurance operations but its funding purposes have expanded beyond that purpose. The assessments apply to all licensed insurers in the state (e.g. life, property and casualty, and health), and are based on New York premiums.In total, the above New York taxes and assessments including Section 206 aggregated to nearly 6% of the 2015 small group and individual qualified health plans&rsquo; premium.IV. FEDERAL TAXES, MANDATES AND ADJUSTMENTSAnnual fee on health insurance providers:Beginning in 2014, this fee is based on each health insurance company&rsquo;s market share of net premiums written, adjusted for size and corporate structure.The federal law requires the total fee on nationwide health insurance providers to be collected is:$8 billion in 2014,$11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016,$13.9 billion in 2017, and$14.3 billion in 2018.After 2018, the fee is expected to collect $14.3 billion, indexed to the rate of growth in premiums.Each year, the calculation will be based on the market share of each assessed plan and will change based on the number of companies in the insured market. Under this fee provision, a health plan could incur financial losses but would still be subject to the market share fee.For EHP, this fee increase represents a 1.2% increase to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans for 2015.Risk Adjustment Program:The risk adjustment program is a permanent provision that applies to both the individual and small group insurance market. This federal program assesses a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and uses the revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members.A fee of $0.96 per member per year is collected to fund the risk adjustment program. For EHP, this program reduces small group qualified health plans&rsquo; premiums by about 1.5%. For 2015, this program has no impact on the premium of individual direct pay qualified health plans.Transitional reinsurance program for the individual market:The federal law created a temporary reinsurance program that is to collect nationwide:$10 billion in 2014,$6 billion in 2015, and$4 billion in 2016.Additionally, a separate contribution is to be deposited into the U.S. Treasury that will total $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016.The contribution rate is to be based on a $44 national per capita yearly amount in 2015. All insurers and self- insured group health plans are required to contribute on behalf of all group health plans and health insurance coverage they provide. For EHP, this fee represents about 1% of premium but it is about 40% less than last year resulting in a 0.5% decrease to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans in 2015.For the individual qualified health plans, the federal government established reinsurance for excessive claims. The amount of money being distributed in 2014 is being reduced in 2015. At the same time, this reduction will require a 3.8% premium increase for individual qualified health plans.Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) fee:The federal law created the PCORI to help stakeholders make informed health decisions by advancing the quality and relevance of evidence-based medicine through the use of comparative clinical effectiveness research findings. The fee is set at $2 per year multiplied by the average number of lives covered under the plan for plan years ending before October 1, 2014. And, for plan years ending on or after October 1, 2014, the fee increases based on the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures.Federal mental health mandateThe federal requirements for coverage of mental health parity require a 0.2% increase to current premium to pay for required benefits in 2015.V. OPERATING EXPENSE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTSA portion of what is reported to the state as administrative expenses is attributed to what Federal Health Reform considers quality improvement expenses, meaning the federal government recognizes that these represent costs that lead to overall improvements in health care versus simply a routine business expense, and as a result will be considered a medical benefit expense for purposes of federal MLR calculations.Those quality improvement expenses include such items as:-Improvements in health outcomes brought about by case management and disease management programs,-Actions taken to help prevent hospital readmissions through such things as discharge planning and counseling,-Wellness and community health promotional activities, and-Health information technology that is used to help measure clinical effectiveness and predictive modeling.The proposed rates will more accurately reflect the true operating expense of administering the federal Health Care Reform legislation through the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange. The changes in the health insurance market required building and implementing an entirely new sales channel from what had primarily been a business-to-business marketplace.This required:-The implementation of a new sales call center that saw extended open enrollment deadlines in 2014,-The hiring of additional staff,-Increased direct-to-consumer communication costs to educate consumers about new products and how to access those products, and-The building and implementation of new products, new infrastructure for the continued improvements and changes to the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange and for the implementation of additional mandates for the federal Health Care Reform.Operating expenses - including quality improvement initiatives but excluding federal and state taxes, fees and assessments, and broker commissions - represent 8.7% of premium in small group qualified health plans and 8.4% in individual qualified health plans.VI. REGULATION 146Regulation 146 was a market stabilization mechanism for the individual and small group pools that was in effect prior to the adoption of the ACA. Similar to the ACA Risk Adjustment program, Reg. 146 attempted to equalize the risk within the small group and individual markets by assessing a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and used this revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members. Because of the redundancy with the new risk adjustment program, Reg. 146 is being phased out. The Department of Financial Services is requiring plans to distribute all outstanding compensations through premium adjustments in 2015 and 2016. This distribution plan results in a reduction in the small group qualified health plan premium of 0.3% and in individual premium of about 1%.",Review Complete,12.20,78124NY103,Univera PPO Hybrid,"Excellus Health Plan, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Quarterly,16.35,16.35,RC

[HIOS Submission #89217-381648]The requested annual rate increase for 2015 for Aetna Life Insurance Co.  is 17.6% which exceeds the 10% threshold.New Jersey finds the increase justified.  Rate increases exceeding a stated amount, such as 10%, are permitted under NJ law if the carrier demonstrates and certifies that the loss ratio will exceed 80%.  Aetna Life Insurance Co.  has provided an acceptable certification and demonstration the loss ratio will exceed 80%.",Not Applicable,"SummaryAetna is filing rates for Individual plans in New Jersey. This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 17.6%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. As of April 2014, approximately 860 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Members currently in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 10.7%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For policies issued to individuals and small employers in New Jersey, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&bull; Expenses for emergency treatment have increased 14%.&bull; The use of outpatient hospital services has increased 9%.&bull; Visits to specialists have increased 11%.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsThe members enrolling in our plans have higher medical costs than we had expected. Part of the increase is needed to better align rates with our current expectation of the medical costs for individuals who will enroll in this product.The rates in this filing also reflect the impacts of a number of ACA-related requirements. These include:&bull; Guarantee Issue and Rating Rules&bull; Changes to Taxes and Fees, and the partial phase-out of the Transtional Reinsurance Program&bull; Changes to Benefit RequirementsWill Premiums for All Individuals Increase 17.6%?No, the 17.6% is an average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the individual chooses.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Individual business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of actions to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&bull; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.",Review Complete,17.60,89217NJ007,Aetna Exclusive Provider Organization,Aetna Life Insurance Company,NEW JERSEY,NJ,Annual,17.60,17.60,RC

If the Plan average risk score is higher than the average risk score for the state, the Company will receive payment for having a higher risk population. Because BCBSTN anticipates its market level risk scores to be consistent with the Tennessee market, its Risk Adjustment is 0. However, due to changes in the URRT instructions for 2015, the $.08 Risk Adjustment Fee appears as -.08 on the Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM line in Worksheet 1, Section III of the URRT&bull;	The assumptions and methods used to determine the&lsquo;Projected ACA reinsurance recoveries, net of reinsurance premium, PMPM of $19.33 appear reasonable and consistent with accepted actuarial practice&bull;&lsquo;Administrative Expense Load&rsquo; and&lsquo;Taxes&amp; Fees&rsquo; appear reasonable for the Individual market.

Therefore, it appears to INS that the proposed average rate increase of 19% is actuarially reasonable. INS shares the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance (Department) concerns regarding the magnitude of the proposed average rate increase, which is larger than the overwhelming majority of rate increases INS has reviewed this year for implementation in 2015. However, INS also has concerns with the developing 2014 experience, which appears to be worse than expected for the six month period. Please note that the 90%+ Loss Ratio through June, 2014 most likely will fluctuate, as it contains only 6 months of experience. The bottom line is that it is difficult to predict at this point the fully developed 2014 Loss Ratio. Limiting the rate increase could lead to BCBSTN requesting an even larger rate increase in the 2015 filing for implementation in 2016.",Not Applicable,"Part II&ndash; Written Explanation of the Rate IncreaseBCBST is requesting a rate increase of 19.0%.  The majority of the rate increase being requested is due to higher than expected morbidity in the first few months of 2014 for the BCBST Marketplace and Non-Marketplace plans, increases in underlying medical cost due to inflation in the cost of medical services, as well as increased utilization of medical services and a reduction in anticipated payments from the Federal Transitional Reinsurance Program. Morbidity being higher than anticipated accounts for 9% of the rate increase.  Increases in underlying medical cost account for an additional 9% of the rate increase, and reduction in anticipated reinsurance payments account for the remaining 1%. Administrative costs are not contributing to the increase BCSBT is able to achieve economies of scale that prevent administrative cost from contributing to the rate increase. Benefits for this product are not changing therefore there is no rate increase for benefit changes.  BCBST does not anticipate making a gain on this product in 2015.As of June 21, 2014 the Marketplace and Non-Marketplace plans had 152,760 members who will be impacted by the rate increase if they elect to renew in 2015. Member increases will range between 6.1% and 21.7% before the impact of advance premium tax credits. The increase a member will see will vary according to their region and network. This variation is due to implementation of requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Individuals will also see an additional increase due to aging. For example, a 49 year-old who will turn 50 prior to January 1 2015 may see an additional 4.7% increase due to changing from the age 49 rates to the age 50 rates.The Marketplace and Non-Marketplace products are new products that were first introduced in January 2014 therefore no historical financial experience exists for these products.",Review Complete,18.81,14002TN036,Non-marketplace Bronze,BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee,TENNESSEE,TN,Annual,18.81,18.81,RC

BCBSTN expects to retain their large market share in Tennessee.URRT Section II Allowed Claims, PMPM Basis&bull;	Benefit Category descriptions closely follow the preferred descriptions of the URRT instructions&bull;	The utilization per 1,000 and the average cost/service factors by benefit category for the Experience Period appear to be reasonable for the Individual market&bull;	The total allowed PMPM claim cost of $227.28 (Section II) matches the index rate of $227.00 (Section I) for the experience period (difference due to rounding)&bull;	The overall Trend assumption is 9.0%. Based on the narrative provided by the company, the trend assumption appears to be reasonable.&bull;	BCBSTN used a&lsquo;Population Risk Morbidity&rsquo; factor of 1.151 to project their underlying experience. The expected increase in morbidity is due to:1.	The expected higher morbidity of new entrants2.	The elimination of pre-existing conditionsBased on the narrative and spreadsheet provided by the company, INS believes the 1.151 Morbidity factor to be reasonable&bull;	The&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factor used by BCBSTN to project their underlying experience was set to 1.145. The main drivers behind this factor were:1.	An increase in the average age of the insureds2.	Additional benefits to meet the Essential Health Benefit (EHB)3.	Normalization of the Medical Plan and Prescription Drug NetworksBased on the narrative and spreadsheet provided by the company, INS believes the 1.145&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factor to be reasonable.URRT Section II Credibility Manual&bull;	BCBSTN used its Small Group projection for its Individual Credibility Manual, without any adjustments. The company believes that the guaranteed issue nature of their Small Group policies will be similar to the ACA required guaranteed issue rules for Individual policies.URRT Section III Projected Experience&bull;	BCBSTN&rsquo;s&lsquo;Projected Allowed Experience Claims PMPM&rsquo; is based 80% on its projected actual experience and 20% on its Credibility Manual.  The company expects that 20% of its 2015 Individual membership will be coming from the Small Group market, the basis of its Credibility Manual&bull;	The method used to determine the&lsquo;Paid to Allowed Average Factor in the Projection Period&rsquo; of 69.6% is actuarially acceptable and such average factor is consistent with the&lsquo;paid to allowed&rsquo; ratios at the plan level&bull;	Companies are allowed to make a Risk Adjustment in developing its incurred claims on the URRT. Risk adjustment calculates a risk score for each plan participant, based upon age, sex and diagnosis. This is used to calculate the company&rsquo;s Plan average risk score. If the Plan average risk score is higher than the average risk score for the state, the Company will receive payment for having a higher risk population. Because BCBSTN anticipates its market level risk scores to be consistent with the Tennessee market, its Risk Adjustment is 0. However, due to changes in the URRT instructions for 2015, the $.08 Risk Adjustment Fee appears as -.08 on the Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM line in Worksheet 1, Section III of the URRT&bull;	The assumptions and methods used to determine the&lsquo;Projected ACA reinsurance recoveries, net of reinsurance premium, PMPM of $19.33 appear reasonable and consistent with accepted actuarial practice&bull;&lsquo;Administrative Expense Load&rsquo; and&lsquo;Taxes&amp; Fees&rsquo; appear reasonable for the Individual market. BCBSTN has set its&lsquo;Profit&amp; Risk Load&rsquo; at zero&bull;	The&lsquo;Index Rate for Projection Period&rsquo; of $370.39 matches the 2015&lsquo;Projected Allowed Experience Claims PMPM&rsquo;. This is expected for Individual plans that provide only EHBs.Part III Actuarial Memorandum&bull;	The Company&rsquo;s actuarial memorandum satisfies the Part III Actuarial Memorandum and Certification Instructions dated March 20, 2014 and issued by the Department of Health and Human Services&bull;	The company&rsquo;s calculation of the projected medical loss ratio (MLR) of 86.4% is actuarially reasonable&bull;	The company&rsquo;s methodology used to derive the Market-Adjusted Index Rate, Plan-Adjusted Index Rates, Consumer-Adjusted Index Rates and Calibration Factors is consistent with accepted actuarial methods&bull;	The Company&rsquo;s analysis and calculation of Actuarial Values comply with guidance provided in the PPACA, HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2015, Final Rule, 79 FR 13743 (March11, 2014)&bull;	The Company did not have any&ldquo;warning alerts&rdquo; in Worksheet 2 of the URRT&bull;	The actuarial memorandum included the required actuarial certifications.Federal regulations prescribed in 45CFR Part 147 paragraph 147.102&bull;	All premium rates vary only with respect to allowable rating factors: [1] family composition, [2] age, [3] geographic area and [4] tobacco usage&bull;	Relating to the family rating and in accordance with the subject Federal regulation, the premium calculation follows a member-level build up approach which is capped such that no more than the three oldest covered children under the age 21 can be taken into account when determining the total family premium&bull;	Relating to the premium age curve and in accordance with the subject Federal regulation, the premium variation between the youngest and the oldest adult individuals between the ages of 21-64 does not exceed a ratio of 3:1 (and adheres to the Health and Human Services&rsquo; Default Standard Age Curve)&bull;	Relating to tobacco usage, tobacco rates are 15% higher than non-tobacco rates. This is within the 1.5 factor allowed by Federal regulation.Miscellaneous Items&bull;	BCBSTN is offering 136 Individual plans&ndash; 14 Platinum, 36 Gold, 61 Silver and 25 Bronze. The company is not offering a Catastrophic plan at this time&bull;	Pediatric dental and vision are automatically included in all of BCBSTN&rsquo;s Individual plans&bull;	Regarding the Consumer Adjusted Index Rates, INS confirmed that:1.	The AV Pricing Value was used in developing each plan&rsquo;s proposed premium rates. This was accomplished by multiplying the proposed premiums for plan 14002TN0220001 by the ratio of each plan&rsquo;s AV Pricing Value to the AV Pricing Value of plan 14002TN02200012.	The tobacco rates were 15% higher than the non-tobacco rates for all ages3.	The geographic area factors were applied correctly to all plans4.	The Health and Human Services&rsquo; Default Standard Age Curve was used for all premium rates.2014 Experience&bull;	BCBSTN provided experience through June 30, 2014 which included membership, earned premiums, incurred claims, pharmacy rebates, estimated reinsurance and estimated cost sharing reduction receivables.&bull;	Member months were in excess of 550,000.&bull;	Cumulative Experience Loss Ratio for the Individual Market through June, 2014 appears to be above 90%.Based on INS&rsquo;s review and on the certifying statements of BCBSTN&rsquo;s opining actuary, INS suggests that the subject filing is compliant with Tennessee and PPACA regulations. Therefore, it appears to INS that the proposed average rate increase of 19% is actuarially reasonable. INS shares the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance (Department) concerns regarding the magnitude of the proposed average rate increase, which is larger than the overwhelming majority of rate increases INS has reviewed this year for implementation in 2015. However, INS also has concerns with the developing 2014 experience, which appears to be worse than expected for the six month period. Please note that the 90%+ Loss Ratio through June, 2014 most likely will fluctuate, as it contains only 6 months of experience. The bottom line is that it is difficult to predict at this point the fully developed 2014 Loss Ratio. Limiting the rate increase could lead to BCBSTN requesting an even larger rate increase in the 2015 filing for implementation in 2016.",Not Applicable,"Part II&ndash; Written Explanation of the Rate IncreaseBCBST is requesting a rate increase of 19.0%.  The majority of the rate increase being requested is due to higher than expected morbidity in the first few months of 2014 for the BCBST Marketplace and Non-Marketplace plans, increases in underlying medical cost due to inflation in the cost of medical services, as well as increased utilization of medical services and a reduction in anticipated payments from the Federal Transitional Reinsurance Program. Morbidity being higher than anticipated accounts for 9% of the rate increase.  Increases in underlying medical cost account for an additional 9% of the rate increase, and reduction in anticipated reinsurance payments account for the remaining 1%. Administrative costs are not contributing to the increase BCSBT is able to achieve economies of scale that prevent administrative cost from contributing to the rate increase. Benefits for this product are not changing therefore there is no rate increase for benefit changes.  BCBST does not anticipate making a gain on this product in 2015.As of June 21, 2014 the Marketplace and Non-Marketplace plans had 152,760 members who will be impacted by the rate increase if they elect to renew in 2015. Member increases will range between 6.1% and 21.7% before the impact of advance premium tax credits. The increase a member will see will vary according to their region and network. This variation is due to implementation of requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Individuals will also see an additional increase due to aging. For example, a 49 year-old who will turn 50 prior to January 1 2015 may see an additional 4.7% increase due to changing from the age 49 rates to the age 50 rates.The Marketplace and Non-Marketplace products are new products that were first introduced in January 2014 therefore no historical financial experience exists for these products.",Review Complete,18.39,14002TN023,Multi-State Plan Silver,BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee,TENNESSEE,TN,Annual,18.39,18.39,RC

The proposed rates also reflect changes inthe taxes and fees imposed on health insurers for 2015.The increase in rates from 2014 to 2015 is primarily driven by deteriorating experience, trend, changes in morbidity assumptions, and reducedreinsurance recoveries.

Scope and Range of the Rate IncreaseCF is proposing to raise premiums by 15.0% on average, prior to age band changes.  The range is 5.4% to 21.0%. For renewing customers, an age band change adds 2.6% to the renewal, on average, with a range of 0.0% to 4.7% for ages 22 and upwards per the CMS age curve.2. Financial Experience of the ProductThe products in this filing were first launched on 1-1-14, and therefore have no experience in the 2013 experience period.  The closed non-grandfathered products from 2013, upon which these rates were based, had total premiums and allowed claims for the incurred period of 1-1-13 through 12-31-13 of $6,355,681 and $7,029,573.The primary factors driving this proposed change in premium rates are:a) Projected significant increase in membership volumes with average morbidities higher than 2014.  CareFirst estimates a morbidity risk factor of 1.35 for 2015.    The morbidity risk factor projections are based upon the model that supported CareFirst&rsquo;s 2014 rate filings.  The model compares known and estimated allowed claims costs per member per month (PMPM) for 2013 to project the costs of various categories of the estimated 2015 membership.b) An aging of the pool of members.  The age of HMO members changed dramatically by increasing 9.3 years, from 27.9 to 37.2.c) An increase in the cost of medical care delivery in the form of claims trend driven by increases in both unit cost and utilization.  See description in section 3.d) An increase in the Health Insurer Fee.  See description in section 4.Our projected DICR for MLR purposes is 83.7%, meeting the 80.0% minimum of Public Health Service Act (PHSA) 218.3.

Changes in BenefitsAdjustments have been made for pediatric dental, mandatory generics, a new Hepatitis C prescription drug called Sovaldi and maternity.CF is proposing to introduce an incentive program (IP) whereby members can earn medical expense debit cards of as much as $250 annually, for an individual ($650 for a family). The cards must be utilized for qualified medical expenses such as deductibles, copays and out-of-pocket costs. The scope includes all benefit plans within CF&rsquo;s portfolio, On and Off the Exchange. This is being done in a revenue-neutral way.Retail Clinics such as urgent care centers will have reduced copays to match the PCP rather than specialist copay with a negligible price impact.For the Young Adult-Catastrophic plan, the deductible-out-of-pocket maximum has been raised from $6,350 to $6,600.A 5-tiered structure (Generics-Preferred, Generics-Non-Preferred, Brand Name-Preferred, Brand Name-Non-Preferred, Specialty) is currently used for approximately 20% of our benefits. This is changing to a 4-tier structure by collapsing the Generics tiers.Included in this calculation are decreases to claims costs for 1) a change in our Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) in 2014 and 2) a reduction in our fee schedule for out-of-network (OON) utilization for HMO-based products that have an OON option (a.k.a., NP3).5.

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 13.1%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 15 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.For Product 83808MS038 the current enrollment is 15. These members will have an approximate rate increase of 13.1%.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 7.7%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer small employers in Mississippi a variety of plans to choose from. Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&#61623;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&#61623; Changes to required taxes and fees&#61623; Changes to Benefit Requirements&#61623; Restrictions on Underwriting practicesWill Premiums for All Small Group Plans Increase 13.1%?No, the 13.1% is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down, others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, the number of members (for family plans) and their ages, where in Mississippi the employer is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of actions to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.",Review Complete,13.13,83808MS038,SHOP HPN Gold,Coventry Health and Life,MISSISSIPPI,MS,Annual,13.13,13.13,RC

This increase is anticipated to impact approximately 67,000 members. It&rsquo;s important to note that a subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate increase could be higher or lower depending on the benefit plan selected, geographic location, dependent coverage and other factors It should also be noted that we are projecting that our medical loss ratio, as defined by the ACA, for all individual products under the Empire HealthChoice HMO, Inc legal entity will meet the minimum MLR requirement.Financial ExperienceFor 2013 Empire reported a 91.0% ACA-defined medical loss ratio (MLR) for all Individual plans, which exceeded the federal MLR requirement of 82%. Empire was not required to issue rebates as more than 82.0% of the premium dollar was spent on medical care and quality improvement programs, as required by the ACA. In total, Empire expects the rates in the small group pool will yield an ACA-defined medical loss ratio of 88.9% in 2015, significantly above the federal MLR requirement of 82.0%.Changes in Medical CostsThe primary driver of the premium increase is the continued increase in the cost of healthcare. The increases are associated with increases in the&ldquo;unit&rdquo; cost of services primarily from hospitals, physicians and pharmaceutical companies, coupled with increases in the consumption of services, or&ldquo;utilization&rdquo;, by members. Increases in the unit costs of services are driven by many things, including technology advances, cost shifting to private insurers from inadequate Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement, general inflationary pressures, and a variety of other factors. The recent approval and release of a new Hepatitis C drug, which currently costs $1,000 per pill and $84,000 to complete the 84 pill regimen, is an example of these increased cost pressures. Additionally, changes in the utilization of services can be driven by benefit design, economic conditions, and many other factors. Within the projected medical trends, Empire anticipates small increases from higher utilization, while the majority of the increases are associated with higher unit costs. Empire believes its projected medical trends are reasonable, and fall within the range of industry norms.What is Empire doing to keep premiums affordable?Empire is investing in many initiatives to reduce the cost of care, promote wellness and preventive care for our members and communities, as well as working with providers to encourage high-quality, evidence-based care, which costs less over time.We are focusing on patient-centered primary care to ensure coordination of care among all settings, rewarding hospitals and physicians for quality and outcomes such as reducing or eliminating avoidable readmissions, and providing the data that our providers need to assist them in managing a patient&rsquo;s overall condition.We are dedicated to working with our members to find health coverage plans that are the most appropriate, beneficial and affordable for their needs. Also, to help our members manage costs, we continue to negotiate the best possible rates for covered products and provider services, and we are making more tools available to help members better manage health and out-of-pocket costs.As a New York based company that has done business here for over 75 years, we care about our customers and the community. We share the concerns raised by our members over the rising costs of health care services and the corresponding impact they have on premiums, particularly in this challenging economy. At Empire, we are committed to driving quality in the health care system, improving the lives of not only the members we serve, but also the health of communities across New York.",Review Complete,7.37,80519NY033,HMO - MSP,"Empire HealthChoice HMO, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Annual,12.66,12.66,RC

(Coventry HL) has proposed an increase of 11.6%, with  this amount varying across plans from between 0.9% and 18.6%. Rate changes were calculated by comparing current 2014 plans to the most similar 2015 plans. Coventry HL experience was considered fully credible, consequently the rate development is based exclusively on a projection of base period experience under this license. Coventry is also including in this filing a quarterly rate increase of 2.1%, based on an assumed annual trend of 8.6%.In the development of 2015 projected allowed claims Coventry HL assumes a trend level of 8.6% between the base period and the projection period. This is at the high end of what we have observed as pricing trend in the market, but not unreasonable.  The largest adjustment to experience is an 12.8% morbidity adjustment reflecting both an adjustment for the change in market morbidity and an adjustment of pre-ACA Coventry morbidity to market levels. In addition, Coventry applies a 3% adjustment to base period experience to reflect very favorable large claims experience in the base period. Additionally, Coventry HL included an adjustment of 1.4% to take into account benefit changes (the addition of essential health benefits), as well as geographic and network differences. Non-benefit expense loads were reduced in aggregate compared to the equivalent rate filing in 2014, with increases in taxes and fees more than offset by reductions in administrative expenses.The change in premium rates by plan is a consequence of a transition to an updated methodology, driven in part by the acquisition of Coventry by Aetna. The updated pricing models with updated large group claims experience data were used to estimate paid:allowed ratios. Utilization assumptions were also re-assessed, using an internal Aetna model of the impact of benefit design on utilization, calibrated using large group claims experience. This has resulted in utilization estimates changing relative to the HHS parameters used in prior years, with greater experience variation being attributed to benefit design.The issuer expects their Federal Minimum Loss Ratio to be 86%, above the minimum required threshold of 80%.They have provided the calculation and we find it reasonable.Coventry HL has provided sufficient support for their assumptions and rating methodology.

The remaining population expected to enroll in the ACA qualifying products represents a small portion of the pool, and those groups generally have unfavorable demographics and higher than average costs.Historical Financial Experience:Three-year financial experience for the HHIC Small Group segment is as follows:2013 Premium $892,423,0002013 Claims $802,561,0002013 Operating Results ($22,664,000)2013 Loss Ratio 89.9%2012 Premium $1,003,072,0002012 Claims $899,818,0002012 Operating Results ($15,687,000)2012 Loss Ratio 89.7%2011 Premium $1,086,460,0002011 Claims $933,662,0002011 Operating Results $34,798,0002011 Loss Ratio 85.9%Change in Medical Service Costs:While the 2013 experience for the non-grandfathered plans rose at a moderate 4.5%, the projected population is expected to add another 19.6% to the cost of medical care per member per month (PMPM).  This is relative to the assumptions used in the 2014 rate filing, which was submitted before the transitional policies were announced and assumed that all small groups would migrate to the ACA pool in 2014.  This is offset slightly by higher allowed demographic factors.Change in Benefits:No benefit changes are being proposed within this filing.Administrative Costs and Anticipated Operating Results:Relative to the 2014 rate filing, internal administrative costs remain essentially flat on a per member per month basis.  The Health Insurer Tax increases in 2015 by another 1.5% of premium.  The total administrative costs are lower, as a percent of premium, due to the higher projected claim costs.The anticipated operating results are not excessive or unreasonable.

In this filing, the company included appropriate rate justifications to demonstrate their rate changes were not unreasonable given the company assumptions about the future, and the experience and enrollment data available to the company at the time of the filing.",Not Applicable,"SummaryCoventry is filing rates for Individual HMO plans in Florida. This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 14.1%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 246,021 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 10.7%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For policies issued to individuals in Florida, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&middot; The cost for an inpatient hospital admission has increased 10.2%.&middot; Costs for pharmacy prescriptions have gone up 9.8%.&middot; The average cost for outpatient has increased 9.5%.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer individuals in Florida a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes increased expected medical costs by an average of 0.61%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&middot;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&middot; Enhanced network access standards&ndash; which limit our ability to control the cost and quality of medical care&middot; Changes to required taxes and fees&middot; Phase-out of the Transtional Reinsurance Program which increases rates for plans issued to individualsWill Premiums for All Individual Increase 14.1%?No, the 14.1% is an average. Rate changes differ by product due to the impact of benefit changes. These average increases are:&middot; 14.2% for the Coventry Carelink Exchange HMO product&middot; 12.5% for the Coventry Carelink HMO product&middot; 10.5% for the Coventry HMO productIn addition, some premiums will increase by less or more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the subscriber chooses, when the subscriber&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling members, where in Florida the subscriber is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Individual business.  Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&middot; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&middot; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access My Online Services, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services. Additionally, Aetna&rsquo;s Plan for Your Health website aims to educate all consumers, not just Aetna and Coventry members, on how to take advantage of their health care benefits.",Review Complete,12.52,57451FL009,CoventryOne Carelink HMO,"Coventry Health Care of Florida, Inc.",FLORIDA,FL,Annual,12.52,12.52,RC

Alaska&rsquo;s general standard of review is that rates may not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory (i.e. not unreasonable).

Based on this review the Division concluded that the average 37.2 percent rate increase was justified and not unreasonable.  The requested rate increase was projected to be significantly less than needed in order to cover the projected cost of claims and expenses in Alaska in 2015 and in determining whether the requested rate increase was in compliance with federal and state rating laws, the Division did consider Premera&rsquo;s financial stability and strength to assure that it was sufficient to make good on its obligation to pay claims.Premera projects that their loss ratio for the individual insurance business will significantly exceed the federal minimum loss ratio of 80 percent and therefore anticipates no rebates will be paid.The rate changes will become effective on 1/1/2015.",Not Applicable,"Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield HHS Form Part IIProduct effective date January 1st 2015Individual Metallic ProductsPremera Blue Cross Blue Shield (Premera) is filing this rate change request to cover the annual cost increases which apply to our individual metallic products both in and out of the exchange in Alaska.Members affected by this filingPremera currently has 6,923 members on metallic plans. 5,013 of those members enrolled through the Healthcare.gov, the federal marketplace. The remaining 1,910 enrolled directly with Premera.Plan design and benefitsThese plans are designed to meet the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirements for actuarial value and Essential Health Benefits.  For 2015 we have added in network pediatric dental class 1 services to be covered in full on our gold plans.Rates and changes in costsWe are extremely concerned about the costs we are currently seeing in the Alaska market and the implications of these costs for the long term sustainability of individual healthcare coverage across the state.The implementation of the ACA has transformed the Alaska individual market. The combination of guaranteed access to coverage, the extension of non ACA compliant plans under transitional relief rules and a state with a comparatively small number of individual consumers may not be sustainable as currently structured.  Although the ACA includes some risk mitigation programs (reinsurance, risk adjustment and risk corridors) these are insufficient in a state that lacks an individual market which is large or stable enough to spread risk.The risk experience in the metallic plan risk pool is further influenced by the fact that 50 percent of the state&rsquo;s high risk pool (ACHIA) and 100 percent of the federal Preexisting Condition Insurance Pool have left those plans and have likely now purchased coverage in the individual market.  Premera may have obtained a disproportionate share of these individuals.Premera is committed to working with the Division of Insurance (DOI), the State, and the industry to develop and implement programs that will help to stabilize the market and keep costs affordable for individual consumers.   As a result, our 2015 rate filing is significantly lower than is needed to break even for our metallic lines of business. Programs such as a supplemental state re insurance program will spread high medical costs across the insured market and limit the need for large rate increases in the individual market in the future.For 2015 a 72.3 percent would be required for this line of business to break even. However, Premera is filing for an average rate increase of 37.2 percent across our individual metallic plans both on and off the exchange.  Based on this filing, rate increases could range from 35.2 percent to 40.2 percent.Key drivers of ratesThese rates are driven by two key factors:The extremely high claims costs that are being incurred by members on our metallic plans.The size and composition of the pool across which these claims costs are being spread.Claims costsBased on data from the first quarter of 2014, our claims costs per member, per month are running at $878, well over the $195 we spent per member, per month in 2013Just 15 new members have incurred $3.8 million between January 1st and April 30th in 2014.Pool size and compositionPrior to open enrollment we had anticipated that approximately 15,000 consumers would enroll in metallic plans. However, most likely as a result of problems with Healthcare.gov and the extension of nonmetallic plans under transitional relief, only 6,000 consumers enrolled.The demographic composition of those that did enroll in metallic plans was older and less healthy than anticipated.Just to break even, given the claims experience we are currently seeing, would require a 72.3 percent rate increase for our individual metallic plans for 2015. This rate increase breaks down as detailed below:Health condition of new enrollees, including from state and federal high risk pools: 56.68 percentReduction of federal re insurance: 7.8 percentIncrease in federal tax on insured health plans: 2.2 percentRemaining factors: 6.2 percent, specifically,4.7 percent for overall rising medical costs1.5 percent for additional fees and administrative costsWe do not want to pass on such a significant rate increase to our individual market consumers in Alaska.  As such we are filing for a 37.2 percent average rate increase for 2015, which includes a projected loss of $5 million for Premera.Expected use of the rate dollarPremera is committed to using our members&rsquo; rate dollar responsibly and consistently pays out a high percentage of the members&rsquo; rate dollar on medical claims. Given the current claims experience for this line of business and our projected losses in 2015, we expect to pay over 100percent of our members&rsquo; premium dollars toward medical claims for 2015, thus incurring a loss on this line of business. In addition to medical claims, the following costs will also be incurred:ACA related taxes and fees, including fees paid toward Healthcare.gov, account for 6.9percent of the rate dollar in 2015.Premera continues to focus on increasing efficiency and reducing our administrative expenses. These costs are expected to account for 6percent of the rate dollar in 2015.Commission to producers brokers is expected to account for 3percent of members&rsquo; premium dollar in 2015Financial experience of the product:2014 is the first year of experience for these products. Based on data through April 2014, Premera currently projects a $3.6 million loss serving individual market customers on metallic plans in 2014 without commercial reinsurance.Our estimates show that without a rate increase for 2015, these losses could increase to $37 million in 2015, based on a market of 12,000 members.

For example, the Transitional Policy that was announced by the Administration, first articulated in November 2013, and subsequently extended in March 2014, is projected to result in a more adverse population than assumed in the current rates because previously medically underwritten non-grandfathered members are allowed to remain in transitional plans.Medical Inflation, Trend, Combined effect of medical provider price increases, utilization changes, medical cost shifting, and new medical procedures and technology.Reinsurance Credit-Reduction in reinsurance coinsurance from 2014 to 2015.Addition of coverage for Essential Health Benefits i.e. Breast Pump expanded coverage, Oral Chemo Parity.An adjustment for additional prescription drugs that were added to the formulary, i.e. Solvadi and Olysio.Increase in Insurer Fee, PCORI, Exchange Fee, as a result of assumed increase in the proportion of on exchange revenue based on 2014 experience.Financial experience of the product. FHCP has only sold PPACA compliant plans in 2014.  FHCP does not have credible financial experience for these PPACA compliant plans.Changes in Medical Service Costs.

(LAHC) is requesting a composite 11.2% premium rate increase for the POS product (HIOS ID 67202LA001). There are a number of reasons contributing to the increase.A key contributor is the reduction in revenue expected from the Federal Transitional Reinsurance Program, in 2014, the Program reimburses 80% of claims between $60,000 and $250,000. This will drop to 50% of specific large claims between $70,000 and $250,000 in 2015 and therefore LAHC will receive less reimbursement.The 2014 premium rates reflected revenue from the Risk Adjustment Program. Based on 2014 enrollment, LAHC no longer anticipates receiving any revenue from this program, which is reflected in the 2015 requested rates.Other factors contributing to the rate increase include:1. Higher hospital, physician, and prescription drug expenses due to increased utilization of services, inflation and intensity of health care services,2. Payment of a federal health insurer tax, and3.

The benefits provided are reasonable in relation to the premiums charged.&bull; Rates are not excessive or unfairly discriminatory.&bull; The insurer&rsquo;s assumptions used in projecting costs are reasonable.&bull; The insurer&rsquo;s past experience and projected experience support the rate increase proposed.",Not Applicable,"Ohio Small Group ACA On Exchange1-1-15 FilingPart IIScope and range of the rate increaseCommunity Insurance Company (CIC) is filing for a 10.7 percent average annual increase for groups renewing on its ACA-compliant Small Group PPO product available through the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015.  This increase is expected to impact approximately 100 members renewing during this time period.Actual rate increases for each group could be higher or lower than the average increase of 10.7 percent, depending on the benefit plan selected, geographic location, age characteristics, dependent coverage and tobacco coverage.Financial experienceIn 2012, Community Insurance Company reported an Affordable Care Act (ACA) medical loss ratio (MLR) of 80.7 percent for all small group plans, which exceeded the MLR requirement of 80 percent.  CIC was not required to issue rebates as more dollars were spent on medical care and quality programs than required by the ACA.  With the proposed rate adjustments in this filing, CIC's Small Group MLR is expected to continue to remain above the 80 percent Federal minimum allowable MLR in 2015.  In the event CIC's Small Group MLR does not meet the Federal required minimum, CIC will refund the difference to policyholders.Changes in medical service costsThe primary driver of the rate increase in this filing is the continued increase in the cost of healthcare.  This is driven by increases in the price of services, or unit costs, primarily from hospitals, physicians and pharmaceutical companies, coupled with increases in the consumption of services, or utilization, by members.  Increases in the unit costs of services are driven by technology advances, general inflationary pressures, and a variety of other factors.  Changes in utilization of services can be driven by the aging of the population, benefit design and many other factors.In addition, for groups that purchase or renew this product from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, CIC is changing the provider network that will be used with this product, to its Blue Access network.  This change will increase the number of providers that members on this product will have available to utilize medical services from.  This change is also expected to increase medical service costs on this product.Administrative costs and anticipated profitsCommunity Insurance Company continues to effectively manage administrative and selling costs.  The Affordable Care Act requires that no less than 80 percent of a health insurer&rsquo;s premium dollars go to medical expenses and improving health care quality, otherwise a premium rebate to employers and subscribers must be generated to refund the difference.  Accordingly, Anthem is filing premium increases targeting compliance with that requirement.",Review Complete,10.66,29276OH075,PPO On Exchange,Community Insurance Company(Anthem BCBS),OHIO,OH,Annual,10.66,10.66,RC

Actuarial Review Commentsa) ACA ComplianceMetal level: 	                Gold, Silver, and BronzeActuarial Value: 	                Low of 0.592 for a Bronze Plan and high of .804 for a Gold Plan.AV calculation method:      HHS calculator results 	The AV metal values were calculated using the 2015 Federal AV calculator. For the benefit designsthat cannot be directly coded in the Federal AV calculator, claim distribution information provided in the Federal AV calculator was used to convert the benefit design into equivalent benefit designs that were coded in the Federal AV calculator.Based on our analysis this plan is in compliance with ACA rating requirements.b) Development of Base Period ExperienceRocky Mountain HMO has credible small group experience. The non-grandfathered experience from Rocky Mountain HMO product experience has been utilized for the development of the base rate.The experience period used for the projection is 1/1/2013 to 12/31/2013 paid through 4/30/2014 and is 100 percent credible. The experience period used in the projection includes 122,334 member months.We verified that the base period experience includes an estimate of IBNR based on historical claim lag averages to project future claims payments.c) Development of Trends1) Utilization Adjustment Trend Development and Application:The average annual increase in utilization is 2.2 percent, with a minimum of no trend for capitation utilization and a high of 3.5 percent increase in prescription drug service category.2) Unit Cost Adjustment Trend Development and Application:The average annual increase in unit cost is 3.8 percent, with a low of no increase in capitation utilization and a high of a 13.1 percent increase in prescription drug service category.3) Population Morbidity Adjustment Trend Development and Application:The single risk pool that will be insured is expected to be a much higher risk than the current insured population due to segmentation and selection resulting from transitional plan renewals offered in Colorado. The estimated impact is a 1 percent increase in morbidity in Colorado.4) Other Trend Development and Application:Costs were reviewed and trends were analyzed over the four year time period ending December 31, 2013.  Trend was normalized for age, geographic area, plan design, mix of business, and other factors. The plan sponsor is including a new drug Solvadi (Hepatitis C drug). Inclusion of Solvadi increases the pharmacy costs by 4.5 percent.Based on the historical analysis the proposed trend for the filing is 8.1 percent. This trend is comprised of a Medical total trend of 6.9 percent, including 2.3 percent for utilization and 3 percent for provider cost increase. The trend is also comprised of a Pharmaceutical total trend of 17.11 percent, including increases of 3.5 percent for utilization, 7.15 for provider cost, and 4.5 percent for the introduction of new drugs. In addition to account for the change in the age mix of the population an insurance trend of 1.5 percent was used.The cost and frequency of medical and pharmacy services continue to rise and prompt the need for a rate increase. The proposed trends for projection are within the normal range and are well supported by Rocky Mountain's historical experience.d) Development of Non Benefit ExpensesThe non-benefit expenses used in the projection are 19.5 percent of the premium and include:Commissions of 2.8 percentGeneral Expenses of 10.7 percentProfit and Contingencies of 4.2 percent (pre-tax)PPACA Fees of 3 percentInvestment Income of negative 1.2 percent.Administrative costs for medical benefits were developed at an aggregate level for all plans based on historical administrative cost PMPMs trended to 2015, taking into account any expected changes in costs.It is expected that Rocky Mountain HMO will continue to meet the requirements of the federally defined medical loss ratio.  The expense loading reflects the operating methods of the company and its anticipated expenses in Colorado.e) Development of Profit/Contingencies MarginThe proposed rate for profit and contingencies is 3.0 percent after tax, including investment income. The plan sponsor is including this profit margin to account for the probability of losses due to large claims.f) Development of Projected Loss RatiosTo develop the projected loss ratios, earned premium and incurred claims from the experience period (representing a blend of new and existing business) will be projected forward to the rating period using the trend, non-benefit, and profit assumptions as mentioned above.The premiums will be adjusted for member persistency and for historical experience whereas the claims for these policies will be adjusted using the trend specified in the trend section of this letter.Using the assumptions, the projected loss ratio for the product will be 80.5 percent which is inclusive of the PPACA taxes and fees in the premium.Total retention is estimated to be 19.5 percent with 10.7 percent attributable to general operating expenses, 3 percent attributable to PPACA fees, 2.8 percent for commissions, and 4.2 percent (pre-tax) for profit and contingencies, including investment income.g) How the Rate Increase was DevelopedUsing the experience and the proposed assumptions the medical loss ratio for the group will be 90.2 percent. To achieve the target loss ratio of 80.5 percent Rocky Mountain need a rate increase of 12.02 percent.h) Consumer CommentsThe Division received consumer comments on this filing and considered these comments in its review of the filing, to the extent appropriate. The Division may have had access to confidential information that the consumer did not. We have taken these consumer comments into account during the actuarial review and determined that the material in this filing is documented and justified.i) Reviewer SignoffSigned by:     Nicholas CrifasiBased on the analysis and supporting documentation we recommend approval for the requested rate increase.j) Contractor SignoffSigned by:     Sanjit Puri ASA MAAABased on the analysis and supporting documentation we recommend approval for the requested rate increase.",Not Applicable,"Document:   HIOS Rate Review - Part II of Preliminary JustificationCompany:  Rocky Mountain HealthCare OptionsBlock of Business:   ACA-Compliant Small Group PlansRate Change Effective Date:   January 1, 2015Today's Date:  August 19, 2014Scope and range of the rate increase:The rate change will result in an average increase in premiums of 12.0 percent. However, due to a state-mandated change in Geographic Area groupings effective January 1, 2015, a specific member's rate change will vary between a decrease of 17.4 percent and an increase of 30.8 percent, depending on what county the group is located in.  It is expected this rate change will impact less than 2,000 members.Financial experience of the product:This product line was launched on January 1, 2014, so there is insufficient data to adequately describe the financial experience from an actuarial perspective at this time.Changes in Medical Service Costs:The cost and frequency of medical and pharmacy services continue to rise and prompt the need for a rate increase.  The Cost and Utilization trends for medical were nearly 7 percent and for pharmacy they were over 17 percent.Changes in benefits:Plans that did not contain pediatric dental benefits were discontinued.  All plans offered in 2015 are fully ACA-compliant.  There was no impact to the premium due to this change.Administrative costs and anticipated profits:The administrative cost target is 14.2 percent with an anticipated profit target of 3 percent.",Review Complete,12.02,80208CO013,SG Silver,Rocky Mountain Health Care Options,COLORADO,CO,Quarterly,12.02,12.02,RC

Following state review of the filing, the rate increase for the plan has been reduced to 12.3%.The main reason for the change was a reduction in the amount of profit included in the rates following our review.",Not Applicable,"Aetna Life Insurance CompanyWashington Small GroupAetna Fee for ServiceSummaryAetna is filing rates for Small Group plans in Washington. This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 12.3% for the Aetna Fee For Service Product.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Currently, there are no members enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 6.9%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons - providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in Washington, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:Costs for emergency treatment have increased 9.9%.Mental health costs have increased 11.4%.Costs for home health care have increased 14.7%.Will Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 12.3%?No, the 12.3% is the average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down, others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling employees, and where in Washington the groupis located.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.  Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions includeDeveloping new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Aetna Navigator, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services. Additionally, Aetna&rsquo;s Plan for Your Health website aims to educate all consumers, not just Aetna members, on how to take advantage of their health care benefits.",Review In Progress,12.30,34673WA009,Aetna Fee for Service,Aetna Life Insurance Company,WASHINGTON,WA,Annual,12.27,12.27,RP

This document provides an overview of that filing.Scope and Range of the Rate Increase:The average rate increase for the&ldquo;Blue&amp; U First&rdquo; family of products is approximately 13 percent.  The actual increase experienced by an individual currently enrolled will vary based upon the plan metal level chosen by the individual, as well as the individual&rsquo;s financial situation and the subsidy level set by the exchange. BCBSKC does not have control over the last two items. Approximate rate increases by plan metal level are below:1. Blue&amp; U First PCB and Select&ndash; Platinum:    Not offered in 20152. Blue&amp; U First PCB and Select&ndash; Gold:	Not offered in 20153. Blue&amp; U First PCB and Select&ndash; Silver:	15.1 percent increase4. Blue&amp; U First PCB and Select&ndash; Bronze:	9.9 percent increaseThe above changes will impact 8,050 individuals in Missouri. There have been no other changes to the rating structure relative to 2014.Key Drivers for this Filing:The rate increase for 2015 is attributable to three main factors:1. Increase in medical cost (includes price, utilization, and morbidity)2. Change in the ACA reinsurance program3. Benefit changes1. Increase in Medical Cost:Medical cost has increased significantly in the individual market under ACA. This was expected due to adverse-selection (higher risk individuals purchasing insurance at a higher rate than low risk individuals).Below are year over year cost and utilization trends (in percentages) from our Missouri individual block of business (ACA and grandfathered) through 2nd quarter 2014:Benefit Category 	Cost  	UtilizationInpatient		           8.6	50.7Outpatient		 12.2	25.0Professional	         10.6	10.7Ancillary		          -4.7	55.0Pharmacy		 39.4	26.2As can be seen by the table above, the main drivers in healthcare cost going from an underwritten individual market to no underwriting in ACA has led to a significant increase in utilization and high cost drugs. These trends should normalize over time as the risk pool of the individual market improves and individuals become more knowledgeable healthcare consumers.2. Change in the ACA Reinsurance Program:Federal transitional reinsurance program contributions and benefit limits for 2015 have changed from 2014. Specifically, the reinsurance contribution has changed from 63 dollars PMPY (per member per year) to 44 dollars PMPY. Further, the claims threshold upon which reinsurance recoveries are triggered has changed from 45,000 to 70,000 dollars (CMS may leave it at 45,000 for 2015) and the federal coinsurance percentage has changed from 80 to 50 percent. Changes in the benefit levels of the reinsurance recoveries will only impact the individual market, while the changes in the reinsurance contribution levels will impact both the individual and small group markets.Our analysis of the reinsurance change impacted rates by increasing them approximately 5.0 percent relative to 2014.3. Benefit Changes:Due to a change in the 2015 instructions for the Federal Actuarial Value Calculator, plan designs that were compliant with ACA in 2014 were no longer compliant in 2015 for the following plans:1. Blue&amp; U First PCB&ndash; Silver2. Blue&amp; U First Select&ndash; SilverIn order to bring the plans back into compliance for 2015, we were required to make a benefit change. For the plans noted above, BCBSKC changed the deductible and out-of-pocket maximum from 4,750 (for calendar year 2014) to 4,200 (for calendar year 2015). The benefit change increased the benefit richness for the noted plans by approximately 4.7 percent. In order to adhere to sound actuarial principles, we raised rates by approximately 4.7 percent (1.047 x 1.099 equals 1.151, the rate increase under&ldquo;Scope and Range of the Rate Increase&rdquo;).Financial Experience of the Products:With data through August, BCBSKC&rsquo;s Missouri block of ACA business has produced approximately 38 million in premium and 64 million in claims (estimated using completion). This calculates out to be a loss ratio equal to 168 percent, where the loss ratio is equal to completed medical claims divided by premium. A ratio larger than one indicates we are paying more in medical claims than we are receiving in premium. The ratio presented does not include the 3R&rsquo;s of the ACA (i.e. risk adjustment, reinsurance, and risk corridor). These items will significantly improve our loss ratio.As our loss ratio shows, the risk assumed by an insurer in the ACA market is significant. However, we feel it will be best for the individuals in Missouri if we manage the&ldquo;Blue&amp; U First&rdquo; family of products and our ACA block of business from a long term perspective. If there are no significant changes to the ACA in the future, every year the number of individuals in the ACA market will grow, which will improve the average risk of the market. Once the market is large enough and the majority of individuals covered have a history of health insurance, we will reach a&ldquo;steady state.&rdquo; We are currently in a transitional period before the&ldquo;steady state&rdquo; and in order to prevent volatile rate increases every year, we are trying to balance expected cost for 2015 and the expected cost of what the market will look like years down the road. We believe the approximate 13.0 percent rate increased proposed by us for the&ldquo;Blue&amp; U First&rdquo; family of products will meet our needs as an insurer and will help the individuals of Missouri find quality and affordable healthcare.Administrative Costs and Anticipated Profits:BCBSKC is targeting an 85 percent federal loss ratio for our Missouri ACA block of business, which is 5 percent higher than the minimum allowed for the ACA individual market (below 80 percent requires policyholder rebates). With current information from our ACA block of business our operating costs, including ACA fees and commissions, are around 30 percent of premium. We anticipate higher enrollment for 2015 which will help us spread the cost over more of our policyholders and lower our operating cost as a percentage of revenue. However, when considering our operating costs, we do expect an operating loss for our 2015 ACA block of business. We are willing to take a loss because we believe it is important to the individuals of Missouri to have access to quality and affordable healthcare. In addition, we see it as an investment into the future of healthcare where ACA is likely to be the fastest growing segment for years to come.",Review Complete,13.31,34762MO015,Blue&U First Select,Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City,MISSOURI,MO,Annual,13.31,13.31,RC

Both the Total Saver Plus (HIOD Plan ID 67183MI0010010) and Total Saver Complete (HIOS ID 67183MI0010011) increased the medical MOOP to $5,600 per year from the previous value of $5,300. This brings to combined medical and pharmacy MOOP for both plans up to $6,600 per year. Benefit changes are not what is driving the rate increase.5. ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED PROFITSTHC targets a loss ratio of 77.4% for its small group block of business plus taxes and ACA fees. This loss ratio allows for total health plan administrative costs and anticipated profits. THC&rsquo;s administrative expenses (as a percent of premium) increased roughly 5% since the 2014 filing.

Under Maryland law, rates may not be inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.  Each rate filing is reviewed on its own merits.  The Commissioner&rsquo;s rate decisions must be based on statistical analysis and reasonable assumptions.  To assist the Commissioner in making these decisions, Maryland Insurance Administration (&ldquo;MIA&rdquo;) actuaries examine the data, methods and assumptions used by each insurer, non-profit health service plan, or HMO (&ldquo;carrier&rdquo;).  They review numerous factors related to proposed premium rates, including the carrier&rsquo;s actual and projected claims experience, medical and prescription costs, administrative costs, and profits or losses.  The Commissioner also considers the impact premium rates will have on Maryland consumers.  Under the federal Affordable Care Act and Maryland law, in the individual and small group markets, 80 cents of every premium dollar must be spent on paying claims or on quality improvement activities that figure increases to 85 cents in the large group market.  If an insurance carrier does not meet these targets, the carrier must pay rebates to policyholders.Modifications to Requested Premium Rates and Basis of ModificationsGroup Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc. submitted a rate filing on May 1, 2014, requesting an average rate increase of 38.1%.  On May 23, 2014, the Company amended its filing to request an average rate increase of 30.2%.  The amended rate filing reflected certain minor adjustments in response to MIA objections, such as modifying its assumptions about projected average age and the projected cost and utilization of dental benefits.  The most significant change, however, was a reduction in the Company&rsquo;s projections about the morbidity of its 2015 individual market enrollees as compared with the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  Specifically, in its amended filing, the Company assigned to its projected 2015 individual market enrollees a morbidity factor that was 1.60 times the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  In its May 1, 2014 filing, the Company had assumed a morbidity factor of 1.75.  The MIA proceeded to review the amended May 23, 2014 filing.The MIA concluded that certain of the Company&rsquo;s data, methods, and assumptions were not well supported, including certain assumptions about the projected morbidity of its individual product enrollees in 2015.  In particular, the Company had not adequately supported its assumptions regarding the number of small group enrollees projected to migrate to its individual products, or its assumptions about the morbidity levels of previously uninsured enrollees.  The MIA further concluded that the Company&rsquo;s actual experience during the first half of 2014, as well as other considerations relating to actual and projected enrollment in the 2014 and 2015 individual market, did not support a 1.60 morbidity factor.  The Commissioner also concluded that the requested average premium rate increase of 30.2% would have an abrupt, substantial, and adverse impact on the approximately 12,714 Marylanders currently enrolled in Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s Affordable Care Act-compliant plans in the individual market, and would introduce a high level of volatility into Maryland&rsquo;s individual health insurance market.The MIA prescribed a morbidity factor of 1.40, rather than the Company&rsquo;s requested morbidity factor of 1.60.  This modification resulted in an approximately 10.6% reduction in the Company&rsquo;s proposed premium rates for 2015.As modified during the rate review process, Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s premium rates for 2015 reflect an approximately 16.2% increase as compared with its premium rates for 2014.&emsp;DeterminationPursuant to&sect; 11-603(c)(2) of the Insurance Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, the Commissioner has determined that the Company&rsquo;s premium rates,  as modified during the rate review process, are not inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.Rate Review Standards and ConsiderationsThe Insurance Commissioner approves health insurance rates in Maryland.  Under Maryland law, rates may not be inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.  Each rate filing is reviewed on its own merits.  The Commissioner&rsquo;s rate decisions must be based on statistical analysis and reasonable assumptions.  To assist the Commissioner in making these decisions, Maryland Insurance Administration (&ldquo;MIA&rdquo;) actuaries examine the data, methods and assumptions used by each insurer, non-profit health service plan, or HMO (&ldquo;carrier&rdquo;).  They review numerous factors related to proposed premium rates, including the carrier&rsquo;s actual and projected claims experience, medical and prescription costs, administrative costs, and profits or losses.  The Commissioner also considers the impact premium rates will have on Maryland consumers.  Under the federal Affordable Care Act and Maryland law, in the individual and small group markets, 80 cents of every premium dollar must be spent on paying claims or on quality improvement activities that figure increases to 85 cents in the large group market.  If an insurance carrier does not meet these targets, the carrier must pay rebates to policyholders.Modifications to Requested Premium Rates and Basis of ModificationsGroup Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc. submitted a rate filing on May 1, 2014, requesting an average rate increase of 38.1%.  On May 23, 2014, the Company amended its filing to request an average rate increase of 30.2%.  The amended rate filing reflected certain minor adjustments in response to MIA objections, such as modifying its assumptions about projected average age and the projected cost and utilization of dental benefits.  The most significant change, however, was a reduction in the Company&rsquo;s projections about the morbidity of its 2015 individual market enrollees as compared with the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  Specifically, in its amended filing, the Company assigned to its projected 2015 individual market enrollees a morbidity factor that was 1.60 times the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  In its May 1, 2014 filing, the Company had assumed a morbidity factor of 1.75.  The MIA proceeded to review the amended May 23, 2014 filing.The MIA concluded that certain of the Company&rsquo;s data, methods, and assumptions were not well supported, including certain assumptions about the projected morbidity of its individual product enrollees in 2015.  In particular, the Company had not adequately supported its assumptions regarding the number of small group enrollees projected to migrate to its individual products, or its assumptions about the morbidity levels of previously uninsured enrollees.  The MIA further concluded that the Company&rsquo;s actual experience during the first half of 2014, as well as other considerations relating to actual and projected enrollment in the 2014 and 2015 individual market, did not support a 1.60 morbidity factor.  The Commissioner also concluded that the requested average premium rate increase of 30.2% would have an abrupt, substantial, and adverse impact on the approximately 12,714 Marylanders currently enrolled in Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s Affordable Care Act-compliant plans in the individual market, and would introduce a high level of volatility into Maryland&rsquo;s individual health insurance market.The MIA prescribed a morbidity factor of 1.40, rather than the Company&rsquo;s requested morbidity factor of 1.60.

The rates set forth in this filing were calculated as directed in the MIA Order, and CareFirst believes that they are inadequate.Accordingly, while the rates in this submission are filed as directed by the MIA Order and based upon the prescribed morbidity factor of 1.40, the information contained in this Actuarial Memorandum reflects a morbidity factor of 1.60.1.	SCOPE AND RANGE OF THE RATE INCREASE: CF is proposing to raise annual premiums by 16.2%, prior to age band changes. (For CFI the proposed renewal is 11.9%.) The range is 13.6% to 20.1%. (For renewing customers, an age band change adds 2.6% to the renewal, on average, with a range of 0.0% to 4.7% for ages 22 and upwards per the CMS age curve.)The primary factors driving this proposed change in premium rates area)	Projected significant increase in membership volumes with average morbidities higher than 2014.b)	Migration in the pool of former enrollees in Maryland&rsquo;s high risk pool the Maryland Health Insurance Plan (MHIP).c)	An aging of the pool of members.d)	An increase in the cost of medical care delivery in the form of claims trend driven by increases in both unit cost and utilization.e)	An increase in the health insurer fee.2.	FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE OF THE PRODUCT: The incurred period is 1-1-13 through 12-31-13. Total premiums and allowed claims for the period were $27,514,930 and $32,329,729, respectively.A.	Changes in the Morbidity of the Population Insured: CareFirst calculated its proposed rates based upon a morbidity factor of 1.60 however, the rates in this filing are calculated based upon a morbidity factor of 1.40 as ordered by the MIA Order.  CareFirst estimates a morbidity risk factor of 1.60 for 2015 as relayed through the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filings (SERFF) on 5-23-14. Our 1.60 factor was computed after consideration for the morbidity risk factor that was included in the 2014 filed and approved rates.  The morbidity risk factor projections are based upon the model that supported CareFirst&rsquo;s 2014 rate filings.  The model compares known and estimated allowed claims costs per member per month (pmpm) for 2013 to project the cost of various categories of the estimated 2015 membership.  These categories are based upon the prior status of the 2015 membership&ndash; previous CareFirst members (medically underwritten under 65 Individuals, MHIP, Group) and New Entrants sorted by income (less than 200% FPL, greater than 200% FPL).  The risk factor for each category is expressed in terms of allowed claims pmpm cost, and is calculated by comparing the category pmpm claims cost to the 2013 CareFirst Individual membership pmpm cost.  More than 50% of the projected 2015 membership is included in categories supported by actual claims data supporting the previous CareFirst member categories.  The New Entrants&rsquo; categories use projected risk scores based upon a Hilltop study (Basic Health Plan) for the members less than 200% FPL and the Group factor for the greater than 200% FPL members. The Group factor is based upon the almost 250 thousand CareFirst Small Group members that have for decades been community rated and guaranteed issue as is now required under ACA for Individual enrollees. CareFirst&rsquo;s judgment is that this extremely large community rated, guaranteed issue small group pool of members is most representative of the New Entrants greater than 200% FPL.B.	Changes in Demographics: Comparing the overall CareFirst member-level average age as of        12-31-12 to 3-31-14, the average age has increased by 4.5 years from 34.0 to 38.5. Age factors will account for a portion of the corresponding increase in claims cost. We find the CMS age curve spread of 3 to 1 to be lower than the 4.5 to 1 that is more correlated with expected claims costs. We have therefore adjusted expected claims costs accordingly in the experience period (EP) index rate projection in the other category.C.	Trend Factors (Cost-Utilization): The proposed trend of 6.5% is a reduction of 270 basis points from 2014&rsquo;s 9.2%. The improvement is concentrated in outpatient hospital and prescription drug services which comprise 37% of total allowed claims.D.	Projected Loss Ratio: Our projected NAIC DICR for MLR purposes is 83.5%, above the 80.0% minimum of Public Health Service Act (PHSA) 218.3.	CHANGES IN MEDICAL SERVICE COSTS: The experience period index rate is a key component driving the renewal. Last year&rsquo;s implicit 2013 index rate was $222 ($203 x trend of 9.2%). The actual for 2013 is $213 for a favorable variance of -4%.4.	CHANGES IN BENEFITS: For CareFirst&rsquo;s Individual offerings in Maryland, our portfolio is not changing. We will still offer 15 benefit plans&ndash; 1 Young Adult-Catastrophic, 4 Bronze, 4 Silver, 4 Gold and 2 Platinum. We have recalculated the costs of&ldquo;Essential Health Benefits&rdquo; (EHB) as well as Non-EHBs.a)	Per COMAR 31.10.39 Utilization Review of Treatment for Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders, Bulletin 14-07 and due to the passage of SB 759-HB 783, Coverage for Autism Spectrum Disorders, we have calculated an increase in claims of $3 per member per month (PMPM) for 2015. This is largely for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) treatments and is a state-mandated EHB benefit. The $3 PMPM is derived from an incidence assumption of 1 in 68 children ages 1-19, an uptake rate of 1 in 3 and an intensity rate of $40,000 to $95,000 per year depending on age.b)	Other adjustments were made for pediatric dental, mandatory generics, a new hepatitis C prescription drug, Sovaldi, and maternity.c)	Other Adjustments: CareFirst (CF) is proposing to introduce an incentive program (IP) whereby members can earn medical expense debit cards of as much as $250 annually, for an individual ($650 for a family). The cards must be utilized for qualified medical expenses such as deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket costs. The scope includes all benefit plans within CF&rsquo;s portfolio, On and Off the Exchange. This is being done in a revenue-neutral way. That is, the cost to CF of the incentive payments was chosen such that they match the expected savings to CF from more efficacious health care delivery. HealthyBlue (HB) was first launched effective 10-1-10 with the objective of motivating and rewarding greater engagement by the member in his or her health, improved wellness and prevention and better provider coordination and quality. As we sought to respond to feedback about HB, subsequent versions were released on 1-1-12 and 10-1-12. This IP represents an evolution of the HB concept. Further, it joins the tenets of HB with our Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) program which was launched on January, 2011.Our aim is that this IP will improve our members&rsquo; health.d)	Included are decreases to claims costs for a change in our Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) in 2014.e)	Membership Projections: We had projected 58% of enrollment in HMO-based plans as of 12-31-14 in our 2014 filings. Actual data as of 4-10-14 indicates that HMO comprises 69% of our CFI members. We had also expected 5% of enrollment in Platinum plans versus actuals of 13%. We incorporated both of these facts in projecting 12-31-15 enrollment.f)	    For the Young Adult-Catastrophic plan, the deductible-out-of-pocket maximum has been raised from $6,350 to $6,600 per year.g)	Also, per HB 0625, oral chemotherapy coverage has been mandated. The cost of reducing cost shares to not exceed those of intravenous chemotherapy has been deemed negligible.h)	Diabetic supplies have been moved to $0 copays. The deductible applies for H.S.A. plans but not for non-H.S.A.s with negligible price impact.i)	    Retail Clinics such as urgent care centers will have reduced copays to match the PCP rather than specialist copay with negligible price impact.j)	    A 5-tiered structure (Generics-Preferred, Generics-Non-Preferred, Brand Name-Preferred, Brand Name-Non-Preferred, Specialty) is currently used for approximately 20% of our benefits. This is changing to 4-tier structure by collapsing the Generics tiers.5.	ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED CONTRIBUTION TO RESERVE: The 2015 desired incurred claims ratio (DICR) is 79.3%.A.	Administrative Expense Load: PMPMs increased by 3% versus 2014.B.	CtR&amp; Risk Margin: Remains at 0.0%, break-even.C.	Taxes and Fees:I.	Community Health Investment of 2.0%.II.

This increase is anticipated to impact approximately 67,000 members. It&rsquo;s important to note that a subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate increase could be higher or lower depending on the benefit plan selected, geographic location, dependent coverage and other factors It should also be noted that we are projecting that our medical loss ratio, as defined by the ACA, for all individual products under the Empire HealthChoice HMO, Inc legal entity will meet the minimum MLR requirement.Financial ExperienceFor 2013 Empire reported a 91.0% ACA-defined medical loss ratio (MLR) for all Individual plans, which exceeded the federal MLR requirement of 82%. Empire was not required to issuerebates as more than 82.0% of the premium dollar was spent on medical care and quality improvement programs, as required by the ACA. In total, Empire expects the rates in the small group pool will yield an ACA-defined medical loss ratio of 88.9% in 2015, significantly above the federal MLR requirement of 82.0%.Changes in Medical CostsThe primary driver of the premium increase is the continued increase in the cost of healthcare. The increases are associated with increases in the&ldquo;unit&rdquo; cost of services primarily from hospitals, physicians and pharmaceutical companies, coupled with increases in the consumption of services, or&ldquo;utilization&rdquo;, by members. Increases in the unit costs of servicesare driven by many things, including technology advances, cost shifting to private insurers from inadequate Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement, general inflationary pressures, and a variety of other factors. The recent approval and release of a new Hepatitis C drug, which currently costs $1,000 per pill and $84,000 to complete the 84 pill regimen, is an example of these increased cost pressures. Additionally, changes in the utilization of services can be driven by benefit design, economic conditions, and many other factors. Within the projected medical trends, Empire anticipates small increases from higher utilization, while the majority of the increases are associated with higher unit costs. Empire believes its projected medical trends are reasonable, and fall within the range of industry norms.What is Empire doing to keep premiums affordable?Empire is investing in many initiatives to reduce the cost of care, promote wellness and preventive care for our members and communities, as well as working with providers to encourage high-quality, evidence-based care, which costs less over time.We are focusing on patient-centered primary care to ensure coordination of care among all settings, rewarding hospitals and physicians for quality and outcomes such as reducing or eliminating avoidable readmissions, and providing the data that our providers need to assist them in managing a patient&rsquo;s overall condition.We are dedicated to working with our members to find health coverage plans that are the most appropriate, beneficial and affordable for their needs. Also, to help our members managecosts, we continue to negotiate the best possible rates for covered products and provider services, and we are making more tools available to help members better manage health and out-of-pocket costs.As a New York based company that has done business here for over 75 years, we care about our customers and the community. We share the concerns raised by our members over the rising costs of health care services and the corresponding impact they have on premiums, particularly in this challenging economy.

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 13.6%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 4,072 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 8.3%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer individuals in Iowa a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements.  There were changes to our estimates for the relative costs for participating providers.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&bull;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&bull;	Changes to required taxes and fees&bull;	Phase-out of the Transitional Reinsurance Program which increases rates for plans issued to individualsWill Premiums for All Individuals Increase 13.6%?No, the 13.6% is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down, others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the subscriber chooses, the number of members and their ages, where in Iowa the subscriber is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Individual business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&bull;	Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull;	Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Coventry's secure member portal, My Online Services, which was designed to empower our members to become more involved in their health care by allowing them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services.

(NAIC code number 55107) has applied to the Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services to adjust premium rates for its community-rated small group and individual qualified health plans.I. OVERVIEWThe rates being sought contain a zero percent operating margin for the health plan despite the health plan reporting operating losses in 2013 and a forecasted significant operating loss in 2014. The proposed rate adjustment is based on the need to adjust prospectively from the state&rsquo;s reduction of rates by 6.3% on small group qualified health plans and by 4.0% on individual qualified health plans for 2014, an increasing medical cost trend, and changes in the health insurance market driven by federal and state actions. Other contributing factors for the proposed 2015 rate adjustment include increases in fees, taxes and added coverage for new mandated benefits.Excellus Health Plan and related companies (EHP) provide health insurance and administrative services for about 1.8 million upstate New Yorkers in 39 counties. The proposed premium rates affect about 182,000 members or 10% of the health plan&rsquo;s total membership. Its proposed rates are subject to review by the New York Department of Financial Services pursuant to section 4308c of the New York Insurance Law. The Department may approve the proposed rate increase as requested, modify the proposed rate increase, or disapprove the proposed rate increase in its entirety. The determination by the Department shall be supported by sound actuarial assumptions and methods.The rate application will be filed with the Department on or about June 13, 2014. The actual rate increases approved by the Department will be communicated to the impacted parties at least 60 days prior to the date the new rate is implemented for the subscriber. EHP policyholders with renewal dates during 2015 would, if approved, receive the indicated rate adjustments on their next anniversary date on or after January 1, 2015.Excellus Health Plan is required by New York State law to develop rates that assume that at least 82% of premium revenue will be spent on health care costs in the direct pay market along with small groups, be actuarially sound, cover all claim costs, and provide a contribution to ensure adequate reserves. The percent of premium attributable to claims is referred to as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).Excellus Health Plan's MLR has been and continues to exceed the statutory minimums. In 2013, the MLR for Excellus Health Plan was 94.2% for individual direct pay and 91.0% for small groups. Under new reporting requirements for 2014, the three-year cumulative MLR is 94.4% for individual direct pay and 91.5% for small group qualified health plans. With the proposed rate adjustments, Excellus Health Plan's MLRs would remain well above the minimum levels. In the event the MLR falls below the required minimum, the health plan refunds any difference to policyholders.Periodic rate adjustments are necessary to secure the ability of Excellus Health Plan, or any insurer, to produce sufficient revenue and surplus for reserves to assure continued coverage and claim payments both for current health care needs, and potential catastrophic cost situations. Excellus Health Plan's reserves vary from year to year based on actual health care costs incurred. As of Dec. 31, 2013, the health plan had reserves equivalent to 2.5 months of claims and operating expense, and more than the minimum required by New York State law. These reserves are the insurance that assures payment even when costs run higher than anticipated, or emergencies or disasters occur, and should not be used as an alternative fund to temporarily reduce rate adjustments.In filing its rate application, Excellus Health Plan is sensitive to the fact that individuals and small businesses struggle to afford higher premiums. However, it is clear that an increase in premiums is necessary to assure the continued operations of the Plan and the viability of its product offerings. Because EHP already has a high MLR, failure to approve these rates would only lead to the need for even greater rate increases in the future as claim costs would eventually exceed premiums collected.II. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASEEscalating health care costsThe cost of health care services, equipment and products continues to be the primary reason for rate increases.Trend is a very important consideration in determining the need for a premium rate adjustment. Upstate New York is not immune to national trends in health care costs given our state&rsquo;s population and demographics. Industry experts such as Segal Consulting and Buck Consultants are forecasting a 7.2-10.4% medical benefit trend nationwide for 2014. EHP is forecasting an overall medical benefit trend factor for its commercial fully insured business of 6.8% for 2014-2015. The trend forecast takes into account projected increases in costs attributed to what Excellus Health Plan pays out in claims expenses for hospital inpatient and outpatient care, professional services, pharmacy benefits and other goods and services. The health plan&rsquo;s anticipated changes in medical benefit spending are summarized as follows:Hospital inpatient, 6.9%Hospital outpatient, 6.4%Professional services, 4.5%Pharmacy, 10.6%Other medical goods and services, 7.5%These trends do not include adjustments to base rates for previous rate increases that were insufficient to cover claims and operating expenses for some plan options.Health care costs for each of those benefit components take into account the compounding effects of both the price of the goods or services provided as well as the quantity of the goods and services consumed.The impact that each trend has to the overall cost of coverage is related to proportionate size of the benefit component. For example, overall spending would rise faster as a result of a 5% increase in professional services versus a 5% increase in drug costs because professional services represents a larger share of medical benefit spending.III. NEW YORK TAXES AND ASSESSMENTSInsurance taxes are built into the costs of health coverage. New Yorkers who voluntarily purchase private health insurance coverage paid more than $4 billion in state health taxes in 2011, according to an analysis by the New York State Conference of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans.New York&rsquo;s Health Care Reform Act of 1996 (HCRA) created two surcharges on health insurance and an additional tax is imposed under Section 206 (formerly Section 332) of the state Insurance Law.The covered lives assessment is an annual flat surcharge or tax on every person who has insurance coverage in the state. Health plans are assessed on the basis of the number of people they cover with individual and family rates that vary depending on the residence of the insured. Among upstate regions defined by the state, the annual covered lives assessment rates in 2014 that impact Excellus Health Plan members are as follows:Per Certificate Per Year by region (Individual : Family)Western: $39.40: $130.03Rochester: $105.72: $348.87Central: $55.59: $183.46Utica-Watertown: $8.54: $28.17Northeastern: $39.94: $131.79The second surcharge created by the 1996 Health Care Reform Act is collected from health plans in the form of a sales tax on many hospital-related services. The surcharge is applied to both self-insured and fully insured plans. Beginning at 8.18% in 1997, the surcharge is now at 9.63%.The third levy, the Section 206 assessment, was originally established to finance New York State Department of Insurance operations but its funding purposes have expanded beyond that purpose. The assessments apply to all licensed insurers in the state (e.g. life, property and casualty, and health), and are based on New York premiums.In total, the above New York taxes and assessments including Section 206 aggregated to nearly 6% of the 2015 small group and individual qualified health plans&rsquo; premium.IV. FEDERAL TAXES, MANDATES AND ADJUSTMENTSAnnual fee on health insurance providers:Beginning in 2014, this fee is based on each health insurance company&rsquo;s market share of net premiums written, adjusted for size and corporate structure.The federal law requires the total fee on nationwide health insurance providers to be collected is:$8 billion in 2014,$11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016,$13.9 billion in 2017, and$14.3 billion in 2018.After 2018, the fee is expected to collect $14.3 billion, indexed to the rate of growth in premiums.Each year, the calculation will be based on the market share of each assessed plan and will change based on the number of companies in the insured market. Under this fee provision, a health plan could incur financial losses but would still be subject to the market share fee.For EHP, this fee increase represents a 1.2% increase to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans for 2015.Risk Adjustment Program:The risk adjustment program is a permanent provision that applies to both the individual and small group insurance market. This federal program assesses a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and uses the revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members.A fee of $0.96 per member per year is collected to fund the risk adjustment program. For EHP, this program reduces small group qualified health plans&rsquo; premiums by about 1.5%. For 2015, this program has no impact on the premium of individual direct pay qualified health plans.Transitional reinsurance program for the individual market:The federal law created a temporary reinsurance program that is to collect nationwide:$10 billion in 2014,$6 billion in 2015, and$4 billion in 2016.Additionally, a separate contribution is to be deposited into the U.S. Treasury that will total $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016.The contribution rate is to be based on a $44 national per capita yearly amount in 2015. All insurers and self- insured group health plans are required to contribute on behalf of all group health plans and health insurance coverage they provide. For EHP, this fee represents about 1% of premium but it is about 40% less than last year resulting in a 0.5% decrease to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans in 2015.For the individual qualified health plans, the federal government established reinsurance for excessive claims. The amount of money being distributed in 2014 is being reduced in 2015. At the same time, this reduction will require a 3.8% premium increase for individual qualified health plans.Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) fee:The federal law created the PCORI to help stakeholders make informed health decisions by advancing the quality and relevance of evidence-based medicine through the use of comparative clinical effectiveness research findings. The fee is set at $2 per year multiplied by the average number of lives covered under the plan for plan years ending before October 1, 2014. And, for plan years ending on or after October 1, 2014, the fee increases based on the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures.Federal mental health mandateThe federal requirements for coverage of mental health parity require a 0.2% increase to current premium to pay for required benefits in 2015.V. OPERATING EXPENSE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTSA portion of what is reported to the state as administrative expenses is attributed to what Federal Health Reform considers quality improvement expenses, meaning the federal government recognizes that these represent costs that lead to overall improvements in health care versus simply a routine business expense, and as a result will be considered a medical benefit expense for purposes of federal MLR calculations.Those quality improvement expenses include such items as:-Improvements in health outcomes brought about by case management and disease management programs,-Actions taken to help prevent hospital readmissions through such things as discharge planning and counseling,-Wellness and community health promotional activities, and-Health information technology that is used to help measure clinical effectiveness and predictive modeling.The proposed rates will more accurately reflect the true operating expense of administering the federal Health Care Reform legislation through the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange. The changes in the health insurance market required building and implementing an entirely new sales channel from what had primarily been a business-to-business marketplace.This required:-The implementation of a new sales call center that saw extended open enrollment deadlines in 2014,-The hiring of additional staff,-Increased direct-to-consumer communication costs to educate consumers about new products and how to access those products, and-The building and implementation of new products, new infrastructure for the continued improvements and changes to the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange and for the implementation of additional mandates for the federal Health Care Reform.Operating expenses - including quality improvement initiatives but excluding federal and state taxes, fees and assessments, and broker commissions - represent 8.7% of premium in small group qualified health plans and 8.4% in individual qualified health plans.VI. REGULATION 146Regulation 146 was a market stabilization mechanism for the individual and small group pools that was in effect prior to the adoption of the ACA. Similar to the ACA Risk Adjustment program, Reg. 146 attempted to equalize the risk within the small group and individual markets by assessing a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and used this revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members. Because of the redundancy with the new risk adjustment program, Reg. 146 is being phased out. The Department of Financial Services is requiring plans to distribute all outstanding compensations through premium adjustments in 2015 and 2016. This distribution plan results in a reduction in the small group qualified health plan premium of 0.3% and in individual premium of about 1%.",Review Complete,9.23,78124NY092,Bassett EPO,"Excellus Health Plan, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Annual,20.73,20.73,RC

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 20.1%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 3,124 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal.  Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase.  We expect medical costs to go up 12.1%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below.  Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Individuals in New York, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&bull;	The cost for an inpatient hospital admission has increased 11.6%.&bull;	ER costs per visit have increased by 8.6%.&bull;	Outpatient mental health costs per visit  have increased by 22.6%.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer New York residents a variety of plans to choose from.  New York does not allow us to vary premium rates by age.  We project that the average individual insured in New York will be older than we assumed when we set our 2014 rates.  This change in average age is expected to add approximately 16.5% to rates.In addition, several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates.  These include:&bull;	Enhanced network access standards&ndash; which limit our ability to control the cost and quality of medical care&bull;	Changes to required taxes and fees&bull;	Phase-out of the Transitional Reinsurance Program which increases rates for plans issued to individualsWill Premiums for All Individual Increase 20.1%?No, the 20.1% is an average.  Some premiums will increase by less or even go down.  Others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, the family size for enrolling individuals, and where in New York the individual is located.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 82% requirement for Individual business. Under the ACA, at least 82% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 82%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care.  These actions include:&bull;	Developing new agreements, arrangements, and  partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull;	Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Aetna Navigator, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services. Additionally, Aetna&rsquo;s Plan for Your Health website aims to educate all consumers, not just Aetna members, on how to take advantage of their health care benefits.",Review Complete,5.32,17210NY006,Aetna Preferred Provider Organization,Aetna Life Insurance Company,NEW YORK,NY,Annual,22.24,22.24,RC

This increase is anticipated to impact approximately 6000 small group members. It&rsquo;s important to note that a subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate increase could be higher or lower depending on the benefit plan selected,geographic location, dependent coverage and other factors.  It should also be noted that we areprojecting that our medical loss ratio, as defined by the ACA, for all small group products under the Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc legal entity will meet the minimum MLR requirement.Financial ExperienceFor 2013 Empire reported a 92.8% ACA-defined medical loss ratio (MLR) for all Small Group plans, which exceeded the federal MLR requirement of 82%. Empire was not required to issue rebates as more than 82.0% of the premium dollar was spent on medical care and quality improvement programs, as required by the ACA. In total, Empire expects the rates in the small group pool will yield an ACA-defined medical loss ratio of 88.5% in 2015, significantly above the federal MLR requirement of 82.0%.Changes in Medical CostsThe primary driver of the premium increase is the continued increase in the cost of healthcare. The increases are associated with increases in the&ldquo;unit&rdquo; cost of services primarily from hospitals, physicians and pharmaceutical companies, coupled with increases in the consumption of services, or&ldquo;utilization&rdquo;, by members. Increases in the unit costs of servicesare driven by many things, including technology advances, cost shifting to private insurers from inadequate Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement, general inflationary pressures, and a variety of other factors. The recent approval and release of a new Hepatitis C drug, which currently costs $1,000 per pill and $84,000 to complete the 84 pill regimen, is an example of these increased cost pressures. Changes in the utilization of services can be driven by benefit design, economic conditions, and many other factors.  Within the projected medical trends, Empire anticipates small increases from higher utilization, while the majority of the increases are associated with higher unit costs. Empire believes its projected medical trends are reasonable, and fall within the range of industry norms.What is Empire doing to keep premiums affordable?Empire is investing in many initiatives to reduce the cost of care, promote wellness and preventive care for our members and communities, as well as working with providers to encourage high-quality, evidence-based care, which costs less over time.We are focusing on patient-centered primary care to ensure coordination of care among all settings, rewarding hospitals and physicians for quality and outcomes such as reducing or eliminating avoidable readmissions, and providing the data that our providers need to assist them in managing a patient&rsquo;s overall condition.We are dedicated to working with our members to find health coverage plans that are the most appropriate, beneficial and affordable for their needs. Also, to help our members managecosts, we continue to negotiate the best possible rates for covered products and provider services, and we are making more tools available to help members better manage health and out-of-pocket costs.As a New York based company that has done business here for over 75 years, we care about our customers and the community. We share the concerns raised by our members over the rising costs of health care services and the corresponding impact they have on premiums, particularly in this challenging economy. At Empire, we are committed to driving quality in the health care system, improving the lives of not only the members we serve, but also the health of communities across New York.",Review Complete,12.53,44113NY038,EPO Off Exchange,"Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Annual,23.49,23.49,RC

NCDOI&rsquo;s decision on the proposed rate increase was based upon the following:The historical data used by the company underlying the proposed rate increase is the North Carolina individual non-grandfathered experience for calendar year 2013 with 3 months of run-out. Actual ACA enrollment and age/gender distributions are updated through 5/31/2014.The filing complies with North Carolina laws and regulations, Federal laws, and applicable Actuarial Standards of Practice. The benefits provided are reasonable in relation to the approved premiums charged.The insurer&rsquo;s assumptions used in projecting costs are reasonable, including annual trend assumptions.The approved rate increase is not unreasonable based upon the expected claim payments, administrative expenses, and margin. The N.C. individual medical loss ratio is expected to exceed an 80% Federal MLR.NCDOI&rsquo;s determination included consideration of the following factors, as applicable:Medical cost trend changes by major service categoriesChanges in utilization of services (i.e., hospital care, pharmaceuticals, doctors&rsquo; office visits) by major service categoriesCost-sharing changes by major service categoriesChanges in benefitsChanges in enrollee risk profileImpact of over- or under-estimate of medical trend in previous years on the current rateReserve needsAdministrative costs related to programs that improve health care qualityOther administrative costsApplicable taxes and licensing or regulatory feesMedical loss ratioThe insurer&rsquo;s capital and surplus",Not Applicable,"August 27 2014Justification of Rate Increase, Individual Affordable Care Act MarketScope and Range of the Rate IncreaseThe overall requested rate increase for Individuals in the ACA single Risk pool is 13.5 percent. this is before any impacts due to member aging.The average increase by product isBlue Advantage 15.2 percentBlue Select 17.0 percentBlue Value 7.1 percentAn individual member may see rate changes that vary significantly from the figures listed above. This may be for a variety of reasons including age, geographic location, benefit plan design, product and smoking status. Individuals will also receive higher increases due to aging if they have crossed a rating age band. Rating factors vary significantly for children versus adults, 21 and over, and also change each year for adults 21 to 64 in accordance with ACA prescribed rating rules. Individuals may also see large changes in billed premiums as a result of changes in eligibility for subsidies or amounts of government provided premium tax credits to purchase coverage on the health insurance Marketplace. This will happen in markets where the second lowest cost Silver plan has changed to a different plan than the year before. The rates submitted by Blue Cross Blue Shield are prior to premium tax credits, therefore the 13.5 percent only reflects the requested change for total premium cost. Individual members will need to go to the marketplace to determine new subsidy amounts they are eligible for to cover premium costs.This filing impacts 317,950 members currently enrolled in our individual ACA market both on and off the Exchange as of July 31 2014. The premiums for this coverage will comply with all the major market reforms established by the ACA that went into effect January 1 2014. Blue cross Blue Shield of North Carolina is committed to improving the health care system in North Carolina, we will continue to work with doctors, hospitals and others to bring our customers innovative solution that simplify the health care system, improve efficiency and outcomes, and help rein in costs.Summary of DriversThe projected risk of the population. Enrollment demographics available at the time of this filing indicated an older and sicker pool than expected at the time 2014 policies were priced. The extension of Transition policies in the Individual market to allow previous customers to keep their pre ACA plans kept many younger, healthier individuals out of the ACA risk pool. Risk selection changes compared to 2014 pricing accounts for approximately 7.2 percent of the increase.Medical trend, unit cost and utilization. increases in provider reimbursement levels and expected medical service utilization accounts for a portion of our requested increase. New drugs, notably the introduction of expensive Hepatitis C treatments such as Sovaldi were not priced for in 2014 and will increase rates in 2015. rising outpatient costs are also a contributing factor to the increase. BCBSNC efforts to contract with providers for limited and tiered network products have helped reduce cost trends overall for the block by over 3 percent versus 2013 levels.We also believe these products will help better manage utilization by steering patients to more efficient or lower cost providers. The overall increase in medical trend contributes to approximately 3.2 percent of the increase.New benefits covered, notably expansion of mental health services to include residential treatment centers, contributes approximately 0.7 percent.Transitional Reinsurance. Due to reductions in the funding of the program available nationally to issuers of Individual ACA plans from 10 Billion Dollars in 2014 to 6 Billion Dollars in 2015, we expect to receive lower credits as a percentage of total premiums in 2015 compared to our pricing in 2014. This contributes to approximately 1.4 percent of our increase.Changes in administrative expenses, taxes, and fees contribute approximately 0.9 percent.We are not requesting any increase in our risk margin or contribution to surplus as a percent of premium in this rate filing, nor do we project to pay medical Loss Ratio rebates as a result of the premium rates requested. In other words, we expect to continue to spend over 80 percent of premium after taxes on qualified medical expenses in 2015 just as we priced in 2014.As demonstrated in our filed 2013 Supplemental Health Care Exhibit, BCBSNC took a 60.4 Million Dollar loss on the Individual segment in 2013 primarily due to higher medical and administrative costs than expected relative to premiums charged.",Review Complete,16.97,11512NC012,Blue Select,Blue Cross and Blue Shield of NC,NORTH CAROLINA,NC,Annual,16.97,16.97,RC

Lower cost small groups are expected to remain outside the ACA single-risk pool due to more favorable premium rates afforded to them in the pre-ACA rating formula.  The remaining population expected to enroll in the ACA qualifying products represents a small portion of the pool, and those groups generally have unfavorable demographics and higher than average costs.Historical Financial Experience:In 2013 KHPW had one small group plan design with little experience and as such is not credible for rate development purposes.The three-year financial experience for the KHPW Small Group segment is as follows:2013 Premium $2,477,4462013 Claims $1,498,4372013 Operating Results $809,5022013 Loss Ratio 60.5%2012 Premium $3,767,0652012 Claims $3,687,1622012 Operating Results ($249,813)2012 Loss Ratio 97.9%2011 Premium $5,509,1172011 Claims $5,140,3422011 Operating Results ($28,307)2011 Loss Ratio 93.3%The KHPW experience has been combined with Highmark Health Insurance Company&rsquo;s (HHIC) 2013 experience to more accurately project 2015 small group claim costs.

This overall trend covers projected changes in utilization, unit costs and mix and intensity of services, for medical and pharmacy claims combined.CHANGES IN BENEFITSThere were no changes in benefits from 2014 to 2015, so no impact to the rate increase.ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED PROFITSDHP targets a loss ratio of 92 percent for its individual block of business.  This loss ratio allows 8 percent for total health plan administrative costs and anticipated profits.  Overall pricing adjustments for administrative and profit loads decreased from prior assumptions due to market pressures.ADDITIONAL CAVEATSThis narrative and the attached filing are intended to support Dean Health Plan&rsquo;s 2015 ACA compliant HMO Individual Rate Filing in the state of Wisconsin.

The increase will affect 6,883 enrolled members and would be effective on 1-1-2015. Georgia applicable laws and regulations include Regulation 120-2-10.12 which requires certification by a qualified actuary that the requested rate is based on actual and anticipated experience of the entire pool of small groups issued in the state. Also, applicable are Regulation 120-2-98, OCGA 33-30-26 and Regulation 120-2-44-.06 which requires that PPO renewal rates be certified by an actuary to not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory and must be&ldquo;filed&rdquo; with the department 30 days prior to use. Actuarial certification was provided along with supporting documentation including prior and project loss experience. Data provided indicated loss experience for the previous rating period produced a traditionally calculated loss ratio of 80% which equates approximately to a federal Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) of 86%. The target MLR per HHS is 80%. Projected loss ratio based on the requested rate increase and a 23% increase in incurred claims is 80% or an indicated federal MLR of 86%. Accordingly, past and projected loss ratios with the rate increase are compliant with federal loss ratio standards.

The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, the number of members (for family plans) and their ages, where in Georgia the employer is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business.

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 11.8%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 65 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 8.8%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer small groups in Oklahoma a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&#61623;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&#61623; Changes to required taxes and fees&#61623; Changes to Benefit Requirements&#61623; Restrictions on Underwriting practicesWill Premiums for All Small Group Plans Increase 11.8%?No, the 11.8% is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down, others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, the number of members (for family plans) and their ages, and where in Oklahoma the group is located.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of actions to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.",Review Complete,11.81,76275OK006,Aetna Health Maintenance Organization,Aetna Health Inc.

To assist the Commissioner in making these decisions, Maryland Insurance Administration (&ldquo;MIA&rdquo;) actuaries examine the data, methods and assumptions used by each insurer, non-profit health service plan, or HMO (&ldquo;carrier&rdquo;).  They review numerous factors related to proposed premium rates, including the carrier&rsquo;s actual and projected claims experience, medical and prescription costs, administrative costs, and profits or losses.  The Commissioner also considers the impact premium rates will have on Maryland consumers.  Under the federal Affordable Care Act and Maryland law, in the individual and small group markets, 80 cents of every premium dollar must be spent on paying claims or on quality improvement activities that figure increases to 85 cents in the large group market.  If an insurance carrier does not meet these targets, the carrier must pay rebates to policyholders.Modifications to Requested Premium Rates and Basis of ModificationsGroup Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc. submitted a rate filing on May 1, 2014, requesting an average rate increase of 38.1%.  On May 23, 2014, the Company amended its filing to request an average rate increase of 30.2%.  The amended rate filing reflected certain minor adjustments in response to MIA objections, such as modifying its assumptions about projected average age and the projected cost and utilization of dental benefits.  The most significant change, however, was a reduction in the Company&rsquo;s projections about the morbidity of its 2015 individual market enrollees as compared with the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  Specifically, in its amended filing, the Company assigned to its projected 2015 individual market enrollees a morbidity factor that was 1.60 times the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  In its May 1, 2014 filing, the Company had assumed a morbidity factor of 1.75.  The MIA proceeded to review the amended May 23, 2014 filing.The MIA concluded that certain of the Company&rsquo;s data, methods, and assumptions were not well supported, including certain assumptions about the projected morbidity of its individual product enrollees in 2015.  In particular, the Company had not adequately supported its assumptions regarding the number of small group enrollees projected to migrate to its individual products, or its assumptions about the morbidity levels of previously uninsured enrollees.  The MIA further concluded that the Company&rsquo;s actual experience during the first half of 2014, as well as other considerations relating to actual and projected enrollment in the 2014 and 2015 individual market, did not support a 1.60 morbidity factor.  The Commissioner also concluded that the requested average premium rate increase of 30.2% would have an abrupt, substantial, and adverse impact on the approximately 12,714 Marylanders currently enrolled in Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s Affordable Care Act-compliant plans in the individual market, and would introduce a high level of volatility into Maryland&rsquo;s individual health insurance market.The MIA prescribed a morbidity factor of 1.40, rather than the Company&rsquo;s requested morbidity factor of 1.60.  This modification resulted in an approximately 10.6% reduction in the Company&rsquo;s proposed premium rates for 2015.As modified during the rate review process, Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s premium rates for 2015 reflect an approximately 16.2% increase as compared with its premium rates for 2014.&emsp;DeterminationPursuant to&sect; 11-603(c)(2) of the Insurance Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, the Commissioner has determined that the Company&rsquo;s premium rates,  as modified during the rate review process, are not inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.Rate Review Standards and ConsiderationsThe Insurance Commissioner approves health insurance rates in Maryland.

The rates set forth in this filing were calculated as directed in the MIA Order, and CareFirst believes that they are inadequate.Accordingly, while the rates in this submission are filed as directed by the MIA Order and based upon the prescribed morbidity factor of 1.40, the information contained in this Actuarial Memorandum reflects a morbidity factor of 1.60.1.	SCOPE AND RANGE OF THE RATE INCREASE: CF is proposing to raise annual premiums by 16.2%, prior to age band changes. (For CFI the proposed renewal is 11.9%.) The range is 13.6% to 20.1%. (For renewing customers, an age band change adds 2.6% to the renewal, on average, with a range of 0.0% to 4.7% for ages 22 and upwards per the CMS age curve.)The primary factors driving this proposed change in premium rates are:a)	Projected significant increase in membership volumes with average morbidities higher than 2014.b)	Migration in the pool of former enrollees in Maryland&rsquo;s high risk pool the Maryland Health Insurance Plan (MHIP).c)	An aging of the pool of members.d)	An increase in the cost of medical care delivery in the form of claims trend driven by increases in both unit cost and utilization.e)	An increase in the health insurer fee.2.	FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE OF THE PRODUCT: The incurred period is 1-1-13 through 12-31-13. Total premiums and allowed claims for the period were $53,936,342 and $62,972,468, respectively.A.	Changes in the Morbidity of the Population Insured: CareFirst calculated its proposed rates based upon a morbidity factor of 1.60 however, the rates in this filing are calculated based upon a morbidity factor of 1.40 as ordered by the MIA Order.CareFirst estimates a morbidity risk factor of 1.60 for 2015 as relayed through the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filings (SERFF) on 5-23-14. Our 1.60 factor was computed after consideration for the morbidity risk factor that was included in the 2014 filed and approved rates.  The morbidity risk factor projections are based upon the model that supported CareFirst&rsquo;s 2014 rate filings.  The model compares known and estimated allowed claims costs per member per month (pmpm) for 2013 to project the cost of various categories of the estimated 2015 membership.These categories are based upon the prior status of the 2015 membership - previous CareFirst members (medically underwritten under 65 Individuals, MHIP, Group) and New Entrants sorted by income (less than 200% FPL, greater than 200% FPL).  The risk factor for each category is expressed in terms of allowed claims pmpm cost, and is calculated by comparing the category pmpm claims cost to the 2013 CareFirst Individual membership pmpm cost.  More than 50% of the projected 2015 membership is included in categories supported by actual claims data supporting the previous CareFirst member categories.  The New Entrants&rsquo; categories use projected risk scores based upon a Hilltop study (Basic Health Plan) for the members less than 200% FPL and the Group factor for the greater than 200% FPL members. The Group factor is based upon the almost 250 thousand CareFirst Small Group members that have for decades been community rated and guaranteed issue as is now required under ACA for Individual enrollees. CareFirst&rsquo;s judgment is that this extremely large community rated, guaranteed issue small group pool of members is most representative of the New Entrants greater than 200% FPL.B.	Changes in Demographics: Comparing the overall CareFirst member-level average age as of 12-31-12 to 3-31-14, the average age has increased by 4.5 years from 34.0 to 38.5. Age factors will account for a portion of the corresponding increase in claims cost. We find the CMS age curve spread of 3 to 1 to be lower than the 4.5 to 1 that is more correlated with expected claims costs. We have therefore adjusted expected claims costs accordingly in the experience period (EP) index rate projection in the other category.C.	Trend Factors (Cost-Utilization): The proposed trend of 6.5% is a reduction of 270 basis points from 2014&rsquo;s 9.2%. The improvement is concentrated in outpatient hospital and prescription drug services which comprise 32% of total allowed claims.D.	Projected Loss Ratio: Our projected NAIC DICR for MLR purposes is 83.9%, above the 80.0% minimum of Public Health Service Act (PHSA) 218.3.	CHANGES IN MEDICAL SERVICE COSTS: The experience period index rate is a key component driving the renewal. Last year&rsquo;s implicit 2013 index rate was $211 ($193 x trend of 9.2%). The actual for 2013 is $199 for a favorable variance of -6%.4.	CHANGES IN BENEFITS: For CareFirst&rsquo;s Individual offerings in Maryland, our portfolio is not changing. We will still offer 15 benefit plans&ndash; 1 Young Adult-Catastrophic, 4 Bronze, 4 Silver, 4 Gold and 2 Platinum. We have recalculated the costs of Essential Health Benefits (EHB) as well as Non-EHBs.a)	Per COMAR 31.10.39 Utilization Review of Treatment for Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders, Bulletin 14-07 and due to the passage of SB 759-HB 783, Coverage for Autism Spectrum Disorders, we have calculated an increase in claims of $3 per member per month (PMPM) for 2015. This is largely for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) treatments and is a state-mandated EHB benefit. The $3 PMPM is derived from an incidence assumption of 1 in 68 children ages 1-19, an uptake rate of 1 in 3 and an intensity rate of $40,000 to $95,000 per year depending on age.b)	Other adjustments were made for pediatric dental, mandatory generics, a new hepatitis C prescription drug, Sovaldi, and maternity.c)	Other Adjustments: CareFirst (CF) is proposing to introduce an incentive program (IP) whereby members can earn medical expense debit cards of as much as $250 annually, for an individual ($650 for a family). The cards must be utilized for qualified medical expenses such as deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket costs. The scope includes all benefit plans within CF&rsquo;s portfolio, On and Off the Exchange. This is being done in a revenue-neutral way. That is, the cost to CF of the incentive payments was chosen such that they match the expected savings to CF from more efficacious health care delivery. HealthyBlue (HB) was first launched effective 10-1-10 with the objective of motivating and rewarding greater engagement by the member in his or her health, improved wellness and prevention and better provider coordination and quality. As we sought to respond to feedback about HB, subsequent versions were released on 1-1-12 and 10-1-12. This IP represents an evolution of the HB concept. Further, it joins the tenets of HB with our Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) program which was launched on January, 2011.Our aim is that this IP will improve our members&rsquo; health.d)	Included are decreases to claims costs for a change in our Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) in 2014.e)	Membership Projections: We had projected 58% of enrollment in HMO-based plans as of 12-31-14 in our 2014 filings. Actual data as of 4-10-14 indicates that HMO comprises 69% of our CFI members. We had also expected 5% of enrollment in Platinum plans versus actuals of 13%. We incorporated both of these facts in projecting 12-31-15 enrollment.f)	    For the Young Adult-Catastrophic plan, the deductible-out-of-pocket maximum has been raised from $6,350 to $6,600 per year.g)	Also, per HB 0625, oral chemotherapy coverage has been mandated. The cost of reducing cost shares to not exceed those of intravenous chemotherapy has been deemed negligible.h)	Diabetic supplies have been moved to $0 copays. The deductible applies for H.S.A. plans but not for non-H.S.A.s with negligible price impact.i)	    Retail Clinics such as urgent care centers will have reduced copays to match the PCP rather than specialist copay with negligible price impact.j)	    A 5-tiered structure (Generics-Preferred, Generics-Non-Preferred, Brand Name-Preferred, Brand Name-Non-Preferred, Specialty) is currently used for approximately 20% of our benefits. This is changing to 4-tier structure by collapsing the Generics tiers.5.	ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED CONTRIBUTION TO RESERVE: The 2015 desired incurred claims ratio (DICR) is 79.3%.A.	Administrative Expense Load: PMPMs increased by 3% versus 2014.B.	CtR&amp; Risk Margin: Remains at 0.0%, break-even.C.	Taxes and Fees:I.	Community Health Investment of 2.0%.II.

These average increases are:&bull; 12.4% for Product (HMO)&bull; 12.5% for Product (POS)The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, and the age and family size for enrolling employees.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of actions to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&bull; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Aetna Navigator, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services. Additionally, Aetna&rsquo;s Plan for Your Health website aims to educate all consumers, not just Aetna members, on how to take advantage of their health care benefits",Review Complete,12.99,82884NJ005,Aetna Health Maintenance Organization,Aetna Health Inc.

The company has requested approval for an overall rate increase of 19.0%, to be effective January 1, 2015. The table below details the various components comprising the requested rate change:Category	                                          AmountTrend	                                          9.5%Benefit Leveraging	                      3.0%Additional Preventative Items	   1.0%Reinsurance Recoverables	   1.3%Morbidity	                                          8.0%Pent Up Demand	                      2.0%Additional Taxes/Fees	                      0.7%Network Discounts, misc.	  -7.0%Total	                                          19%In support of their request, TIC has provided premium rates, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template, a Part II Written Explanation of The Rate Increase, and a Part III Actuarial Memorandum. The actuarial memorandum included, inter alia, actuarial assumptions, anticipated loss ratios, other information required by the ACA and appropriate actuarial certifications.INS has reviewed the submission in its entirety. However, INS has given special consideration in its review to the details of the Company&rsquo;s Part III Actuarial Memorandum, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template and the characteristics of the rating elements subject to the Federal regulations prescribed in 45CFR Part 147 paragraph 147.102.  Based on that review, INS has come to the following key conclusions:URRT Section 1 Experience Period Data&bull;	Earned premiums, incurred claims, allowed claims and index rate per member per month (PMPM) for the experience period, January 2013 through December 2013, appear lower than average&bull;	The completion method used to determine estimated incurred claims and allowed claims is consistent with accepted actuarial methods&bull;	TIC anticipates paying $1,100,005 in MRL rebates, based on its 2013 experience&bull;	Member months for the Experience Period, 53,411, is expected to increase to 73,111 for the Projection Period. The projected membership is based on applying monthly lapse rates to the current membership and anticipated enrollment from new members. Based on the narrative provided by the company, the projection appears reasonable.URRT Section II Allowed Claims, PMPM Basis&bull;	Benefit Category descriptions closely follow the preferred descriptions of the URRT instructions&bull;	The utilization per 1,000 and the average cost/service factors by benefit category for the Experience Period appear to be  lower than average for the Individual market&bull;	The total allowed PMPM claim cost of $210.02 (Section II) matches the index rate of $210.00 (Section I) for the experience period (difference due to rounding)&bull;	The overall annual Trend assumption of 9.5% was developed from the nationwide experience of TIC&rsquo;s affiliate companies (Assurant Health). Based on the narrative provided in the Actuarial Memorandum, the trend assumption appears to be reasonable.&bull;	TIC used a&lsquo;Population Risk Morbidity&rsquo; factor of 1.313 to project their underlying experience.Based on the narrative and chart provided by the company, INS believes the 1.313 Morbidity factor to be reasonable&bull;	The&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factor used by TIC to project their underlying experience was set to 1.104. The main drivers behind this factor were:1.	Additional benefits to meet the Essential Health Benefit (EHB) guidelines2.	The belief that the current average Actuarial Value of its block of business will increase from 60% to 71%, resulting in greater induced utilizationBased on the narrative and chart provided by the company, INS believes the 1.104&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factor to be reasonable.URRT Section II Credibility Manual&bull;	The basis of TIC&rsquo;s Credibility Manual is Assurant Health&rsquo;s nationwide Individual health experience for 2013. This is an appropriate basis for the company&rsquo;s Credibility Manual&bull;	The Trend, Population Risk Mortality and Other Factors used in the Credibility were the same as those used for the Experience Period projections&bull;	Based on the narrative provided by the company, the development of the Credibility Manual appears reasonable.URRT Section III Projected Experience&bull;	In pricing its plans for 2015, TIC used both grandfathered and non-grandfathered experience for its underlying data. Since the URRT requires only non-grandfathered data be used in the Experience Period, the company&rsquo;s pricing approach was incompatible with the Experience Period data. As a result, TIC assigned 0% credibility to its Experience Period data. INS believes this to be reasonable&bull;	The method used to determine the&lsquo;Paid to Allowed Average Factor in the Projection Period&rsquo; of 71.3% is actuarially acceptable and such average factor is consistent with the&lsquo;paid to allowed&rsquo; ratios at the plan level (before leveraging adjustment)&bull;	Companies are allowed to make a Risk Adjustment in developing its incurred claims on the URRT. Risk adjustment calculates a risk score for each plan participant, based upon age, sex and diagnosis. This is used to calculate the company&rsquo;s Plan average risk score. If the Plan average risk score is higher than the average risk score for the state, the Company will receive payment for having a higher risk population. Because TIC anticipates its market level risk scores to be consistent with the Tennessee market, its Risk Adjustment is 0. However, due to changes in the URRT instructions for 2015, the $.08 Risk Adjustment Fee appears as -.08 on the Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM line in Worksheet 1, Section III of the URRT&bull;	The assumptions and methods used to determine the&lsquo;Projected ACA reinsurance recoveries, net of reinsurance premium, PMPM of $31.39 appear reasonable and consistent with accepted actuarial practice&bull;	The combined&lsquo;Administrative Expense Load&rsquo;,&lsquo;Profit&amp; Risk Load&rsquo; and&lsquo;Taxes&amp; Fees&rsquo; appear higher than average for the Individual market&bull;	The&lsquo;Index Rate for Projection Period&rsquo; of $491.66 matches the 2015&lsquo;Projected Allowed Experience Claims PMPM&rsquo;. This is expected for Individual plans that provide only EHBs.Part III Actuarial Memorandum&bull;	The Company&rsquo;s actuarial memorandum satisfies the Part III Actuarial Memorandum and Certification Instructions dated March 20, 2014 and issued by the Department of Health and Human Services&bull;	The company calculated their projected medical loss ratio (MLR) to be 80.0%. An independent calculation by INS yielded a 78.9% MLR. Please note that the company stated in the Actuarial Memorandum that&ldquo;If applicable, rebates will be paid to customers in accordance with federal regulations and based upon actual experience&rdquo;&bull;	The company&rsquo;s methodology used to derive the Market Adjusted Index Rate, Plan Adjusted Index Rates, Consumer Adjusted Index Rates and Calibration Factors is consistent with accepted actuarial methods&bull;	The Company&rsquo;s analysis and calculation of Actuarial Values comply with guidance provided in the PPACA, HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2015, Final Rule, 79 FR 13743 (March11, 2014)&bull;	The Company has responded to the indicated&lsquo;warning alerts&rsquo; in Worksheet 2 of the URRT&bull;	The Actuarial Memorandum included the required actuarial certifications, including the additional certification mandated by regulation 45 CFR Part 156,&sect;156.35 for those plans in which the AV Calculator was not used to determine the AV Metal Value.Federal regulations prescribed in 45CFR Part 147 paragraph 147.102&bull;	All premium rates vary only with respect to allowable rating factors: [1] family composition, [2] age, [3] geographic area and [4] tobacco usage&bull;	Relating to the family rating and in accordance with the subject Federal regulation, the premium calculation follows a member-level build up approach which is capped such that no more than the three oldest covered children under the age 21 can be taken into account when determining the total family premium&bull;	Relating to the premium age curve and in accordance with the subject Federal regulation, the premium variation between the youngest and the oldest adult individuals between the ages of 21-64 does not exceed a ratio of 3:1 (and adheres to the Health and Human Services&rsquo; Default Standard Age Curve)&bull;	Relating to tobacco usage, tobacco rates are 20% higher than non-tobacco rates. This is within the 1.5 factor allowed by Federal regulation.Miscellaneous Items&bull;	TIC is offering 190 Individual plans&ndash; 25 Platinum, 25 Gold, 50 Silver, 80 Bronze and 10 Catastrophic&bull;	Pediatric dental benefits are automatically included in all of TIC&rsquo;s Individual plans&bull;	Regarding the Consumer Adjusted Index Rates, INS confirmed that:1.	Although the URRT does not demonstrate the process used by TIC to develop its rates, the AV Pricing Value was used in developing each plan&rsquo;s proposed premium rates, as premiums for a given age and geographic area for different plans are in the same ratio as the plans&rsquo; AV Pricing Values2.	The tobacco rates were 20% higher than the non-tobacco rates for all ages3.	The geographic area factors were applied correctly to all plans4.	The Health and Human Services&rsquo; Default Standard Age Curve was used for all premium ratesBased on INS&rsquo;s review and on the certifying statements of TIC&rsquo;s opining actuary, INS suggests that the subject filing is compliant with Tennessee and PPACA regulations and suggests approval pending the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance review of the filing.",Not Applicable,"This is a Time Insurance Company rate filing for our existing individual medical products.These are non-grandfathered Individual Major Medical products which cover the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) as required under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

The range of rate increase is 0% -32%, not including attained age.  There are 1,985 covered individuals who will be impacted by this rate increase in Tennessee.  The rate increase will be effective January 1, 2015.The rate increase was developed based on the pricing methodology prescribed by the ACA.This rate increase is needed because allowed medical trend is assumed to continue at an annual rate of 9.5%.  This includes increases in both the price and utilization of medical services.  In addition, there are new fees associated with the ACA which contributed to the rate increase. The increase is also caused by a decrease in reinsurance recoveries provided by the ACA reinsurance program.The loss ratio is the ratio of incurred claims to earned premium.  In Tennessee, the target loss ratio is 73.5%, which equates to the 80% Medical Loss Ratio under the ACA after allowable adjustments.The main drivers of our administrative expenses are employee salaries and benefits, agent commissions, and premium taxes, licenses and fees.

Under Maryland law, rates may not be inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or excessive in relation to benefits.  Each rate filing is reviewed on its own merits.  The Commissioner&rsquo;s rate decisions must be based on statistical analysis and reasonable assumptions.  To assist the Commissioner in making these decisions, Maryland Insurance Administration (&ldquo;MIA&rdquo;) actuaries examine the data, methods and assumptions used by each insurer, non-profit health service plan, or HMO (&ldquo;carrier&rdquo;).  They review numerous factors related to proposed premium rates, including the carrier&rsquo;s actual and projected claims experience, medical and prescription costs, administrative costs, and profits or losses.  The Commissioner also considers the impact premium rates will have on Maryland consumers.  Under the federal Affordable Care Act and Maryland law, in the individual and small group markets, 80 cents of every premium dollar must be spent on paying claims or on quality improvement activities that figure increases to 85 cents in the large group market.  If an insurance carrier does not meet these targets, the carrier must pay rebates to policyholders.Considerations and Modifications to Requested Premium RatesCoventry Health&amp; Life Insurance Company requested a 19.0% rate increase, on average, for its small group PPO product. The proposed increase was due, in part, to combining Coventry Health&amp; Life Company (&ldquo;Coventry&rdquo;) and Aetna Life Insurance Company&rsquo;s (&ldquo;Aetna&rdquo;) experience for rate development purposes.  In the company&rsquo;s 2014 rate filing, it used only its own experience to develop the rates as the company considered Coventry experience alone to be fully credible.During the rate review process, the MIA concluded that Coventry&rsquo;s experience alone was fully credible for this year&rsquo;s rate filing as was the case for last year.  Given the membership levels of Aetna and Coventry, the differences in providers between Aetna&rsquo;s and Coventry&rsquo;s networks, the differences in the plans available for purchase, the relationship of the 2014 Coventry claims experience versus the 2014 Aetna claims experience, and the impact the requested rate increase would have upon Maryland members currently enrolled in the product, the MIA required the Company to consider only Coventry experience for rate development purposes. The modification resulted in an approximate 6.8% reduction in the company&rsquo;s proposed first quarter premium rates for 2015.As modified during the rate review process, Coventry Health&amp; Life&rsquo;s premium rates for first quarter 2015 reflect an approximate 10.9% increase as compared with its premium rates for first quarter 2014.Final DeterminationPursuant to&sect; 11-603(c)(2) of the Insurance Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, the Commissioner has determined that the Company&rsquo;s requested premium rates, as modified during the rate review process, are not inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.",Not Applicable,"SummaryCoventry is filing rates for Small Group plans in Maryland. This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 11.4%.Who is affected?The new rates will apply to policies that start from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 14,505 members currently are enrolled in plans that will no longer be available due to ACA provisions. These members will have the option to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.What are the major factors driving the rate level?Medical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up around 7%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.In addition to increasing medical costs, we are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes increased expected medical costs by an average of 7%. We have also updated our assumptions around the Affordable Care Act (ACA) required taxes and fees.How will premiums change?Some premiums will increase and others will even go down. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling employees, where in Maryland the group is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business.

However, early indications show members signing up for ACA are significantly more risky than previously projected.  This difference in risk profile from previous projections is partially due to the transitional policy for non-ACA compliant plans, and is a market wide occurrence, not company specific.CHANGES IN MEDICAL SERVICE COSTSThe projection of claims from the experience period to the effective period assumes a 7 percent annual trend.  This claim assumption is based on analysis of the health plan&rsquo;s recent and expected experience.  This overall trend covers projected changes in utilization, unit costs and mix and intensity of services, for medical and pharmacy claims combined.CHANGES IN BENEFITSThere were no changes in benefits from 2014 to 2015, so no impact to the rate increase.ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED PROFITSDHP targets a loss ratio of 90.3 percent for its Small Group block of business.

If the Plan average risk score is higher than the average risk score for the state, the Company will receive payment for having a higher risk population. Because HIC anticipates its market level risk scores to be consistent with the Tennessee market, its Risk Adjustment is 0.

Premier was evaluated on its own, and SmartSense and SmartSense with Enhanced Rx were evaluated together.  The rest of the products were combined into one filing, along with their grandfathered counterparts.The historical trends for the allowed claims were analyzed and projected forward to the projection period.  Among the items analyzed were medical and pharmacy claims trend which includes increases in the prices of services as well as the consumption of services, deductible leveraging, durational impacts, plan mix, seasonality impact and benefit factor changes.As shown in the Unified Rate Review Template, there are several factors which contribute to a rate increase.  Our normal rate development process applies an overall combined medical and pharmacy trend to the historical claims.  We do not apply separate trends to each service category.  Therefore, the dollar amounts shown in Section II of Worksheet 2 of the Unified Rate Review Template are rough estimates based on an allocation of the rate increase to all areas proportionally to their historical experience.  However, the allocation shows that increases in all medical costs are approximately eighty percent of the rate increase, with increases in administration expenses comprising the bulk of the remainder.The actuarial memorandum in Part III provides greater detail about the historical experience and forecasted projections of the various policies.At Anthem Health Plans of Virginia we understand that these are difficult economic times, and we are committed to working to moderate the impact of rate increases on our members while continuing to provide access to high quality, affordable health care.

The actual increase experienced by a group upon renewal will vary depending on the age and gender makeup of the group, their location, the group&rsquo;s current underwriting status, their current plan, and the Affordable Care Act compliant plan they choose to select upon renewal.  The ranges of impacts due to rate changes requested in this filing are as a result of the following parameters.Elimination of rating groups due to the health status of their members.Elimination of gender rating.Changes to allow no greater than a 3 to 1 difference in premium between adult ages 21 to 64, and prescribed adult and child age rating factors established by HHS.Implementation of single year age bands for adults 21 to 64.Changes to the method of rating to calculate group rates at a member level.  Elimination of composite rating and counting no more than three child dependents toward a family premium.Changes in the pricing values of specific benefit designs.New geographic pricing regions and updated geography pricing factors that no longer allow or make use of a region&rsquo;s overall health status in pricing.Groups that are on plans below the minimum allowed benefit level or that will need to move to a more generous level of plan cost sharing as a result of ACA requirements.Groups that need to move to new plan designs to remain within mandated ranges in benefit levels, for example, prescribed metal levels of benefits.The impact for groups will range from a 41 percent reduction to a 284 percent increase.  This does not reflect any impacts due to member aging, and is based on the sample of 2013 groups that have renewed with us through March of this year.  This includes required benefit changes.  Before the required changes, the largest increase would be 249 percent.  The ultimate range of impacts will vary depending on the profile of groups that will continue to renew throughout the year, or changes in the age make-up of our groups.This filing impacts 233,950 members currently enrolled in our Small Group market as of March 2013.Financial Experience for the ProductIn 2010, BCBSNC collected 1108.8 million in revenue and paid 919.0 million in claims for Small Groups.  The operating income before federal income tax was 22.7 million or 2 percent of revenue.In 2011, BCBSNC collected 1067.0 million in revenue and paid 883.0 million in claims for Small Groups.  The operating income before federal income tax was 29.5 million or 2.8 percent of revenue.In 2012, BCBSNC collected 1024.3 million in revenue and paid 837.2 million in claims for Small Groups.  The operating income before federal income tax was 38.1 million or 3.7 percent of revenue.The projected rate action is estimated to result in 1211.5 million in revenue based on current membership with anticipated paid claims of 966.3 million 2014.  We expect this rate action to deliver a 3 percent of gross revenue in contribution to surplus prior to federal income tax.  Favorable financial experience has allowed us to reduce premiums by .2 percent.Changes in Medical Service CostsThe cost of providing medical care to our members is by far the largest portion of premium expense.  The following changes in medical service costs and utilization contribute to the overall rate increase.Increases in both unit costs and utilization of knee and hip surgeries.Increases in outpatient costs per visit of 8.1 percent, driven primarily by gastroenterology costs and orthopedic costs.Increases in outpatient utilization of .8 percent, driven by chemical dependency services.Increases in professional costs of 2.5 percent, driven heavily by treatment of GERD and colonoscopies, and endocrinology treatments for obesity.Increases in professional utilization of 1.1 percent, due to increases in office visits, including mental health treatment.Increases in pharmacy costs per prescription of 2.1 percent due to increases in use of high cost, specialty medications.  Increases in specialty drug costs alone rose by 15.5 percent in 2012 compared to a decline in non specialty drug costs on a per member per month basis.In total, changes in the underlying cost of providing medical services to our current members add 7.1 percent to our rate increase.Changes in utilization patterns, primarily driven by the elimination of copayments once the member out of pocket maximum is reached, and the overall expected risk of our Small Group pool in 2014 add an additional 1.5 percent combined.Changes in BenefitsAdditional benefits will add 4.7 percent to the rate increase in 2014.BCBSNC has developed new plans to remain compliant with the Affordable Care Act.  These plans eliminate dollar limits on any essential health benefits and implement out of pocket maximiums that limit any type of member of out of pocket cost, including copayments, as required by law.  Furthermore, groups will need to move to a plan compliant with federally required ranges for plan cost sharing or actuarial value. Upon renewal,  groups will be presented a renewal with a default plan most comparable to their current plan.  Groups will have a choice of any plan offered in the market, however, the rate increase presented in this filing reflects the extimated overall impact of the change in premium including any required changes in benefit design, as described above.  The required changes in design add 3.5 percent to the rate increase.  Please note that we have reduced the number of benefit designs offered in the market in order to comply with mandated levels of benefits, which means certain combinations of benefit levels currently offered in the market will no longer be available.Additionally, Small Group members will receive coverage of pediatric dental and vision benefits which add another 1.2 percent to the rate increase.  These benefits are required to be covered as essential health benefits under the Affordable Care Act.Changes in administrative costs and profitNew taxes and fees required by the Affordable Care Act have an impact on rates.  These include the Health Insurer Tax, Transitional Reinsurance Fee, the Federal Exchange User Fee, Patient Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund Fee, and the federal Risk Adjustment Program Fee.  In total, these fees and taxes add 2.3 percent to the premiums for Small Groups in 2014.  Groups renewing earlier in the year will be more adversely impacted by these taxes and fees than groups renewing later in the year.Other changes to non claims expenses such as administrative expenses, commission payments to brokers and agents, and contributions to surplus in total add 1.4 percent to the rate increase.Addressing AffordabilityBlue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina is committed to reducing medical premium costs for owners of Small businesses in North Carolina and improving the health of our policyholders.

The premium rates are to be effective from January 1, 2014.After a review of the actuarial memorandum and Unified Rate Review Template (URRT) filed in support of the subject rate filing, INS identified on June 28, 2013 several matters that required additional clarification. On July 16, 2013, HIC provided clarification that responded to the questions raised by INS.In support of their request, HIC has provided historical experience, premium rates, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template and a Part III Actuarial Memorandum. The actuarial memorandum included, inter alia, actuarial assumptions, anticipated loss ratios, other information required by the ACA and appropriate actuarial certifications.INS has reviewed the submission in its entirety. However, INS has given special consideration in its review to the details of the Company&rsquo;s Part III Actuarial Memorandum, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template and the characteristics of the rating elements subject to the Federal regulations prescribed in 45CFR Part 147 paragraph 147.102. Based on that review, INS has come to the following key conclusionsURRT Section 1 Experience Period Data&bull; Although limited, earned premiums, incurred claim, allowed claims and index rate PMPM for the experience period, January 2012 through December 2012, appear reasonable for the individual market,&bull; The completion method used to determine estimated incurred claims and allowed claims is consistent with accepted actuarial methods:&bull; The ratio of incurred claims to allowed claims for the experience period (58.5%) and the projection period (60.3%) are closely consistent.&bull; Member months for the experience period (99,879) grows significantly to (558,093) for projection period. This growth projection relies on the Company&rsquo;s assumptions that the individual market will increase significantly.URRT Section II Allowed Claims, PMPM Basis&bull; Benefit Category descriptions closely follow the preferred descriptions of the URRT instructions,&bull; The utilization per 1000 and the average cost/service factors by benefit category appear to be reasonable for the individual market,&bull; The total allowed PMPM claim cost of $174.64 matches the average index rate of $174.64 for the experience period,&bull; Relating to the expected changes in the morbidity of the population insured, HIC provided the underlying assumptions which were used to develop these changes. The methods and assumptions used to determine the expected 52% risk pool change appear actuarially reasonable and consistent with actuarial methods.&bull; Relating to the&ldquo;other&rdquo; adjustments attributable to expected changes in benefits (4.2%), changes in demographics (-0.1%) and new networks impact (-5.7%), the methods and assumptions used to determine the adjustment of -1.9% appears actuarially reasonable and consistent with actuarial methods.&bull; Relating to the expected annualized trend factors, these factors reflect the pool experience of Humana&rsquo;s Individual Commercial block of business.

These trend factors affect health insurance premiums, which can mean a premium rate increase to cover costs.  Some of the key health care cost trends that have affected this year&rsquo;s rate actions include:-Increasing Cost of Medical Services&ndash; Annual increases in reimbursement rates to health care providers&ndash; such as hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical companies.-Increased Utilization&ndash; The number of office visits and other services continues to grow.  In addition, total health care spending will vary by the intensity of care and use of different types of health services. Patients who are sicker generally have a higher intensity of health care utilization. The price of care can be affected by the use of expensive procedures such as surgery vs. simply monitoring or providing medications.-Higher Costs from Deductible Leveraging&ndash; Health care costs continue to rise every year, while deductibles and copayments remain the same.  As a result, a greater percentage of health care costs need to be covered by health insurance premiums each year.-Cost shifting from the public to the private sector&ndash; Reimbursements from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to hospitals are no longer covering all of the cost of care.  The cost difference is being shifted to private health plans. Additionally, Medicare and Medicaid rates to hospitals are expected to decline due to the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on Medicare and the effect of the recession on Medicaid.  A rate increase paid by Medicaid to hospitals is often below the actual cost increase hospitals will experience.-Impact of New Technology - Improvements to medical technology and clinical practice require use of more expensive services - leading to increased health care spending and utilization.-Underwriting Wear Off&ndash; The variation by policy duration in individual medical insurance claims, where claims are higher at later policy durations as more time has elapsed since initial underwriting.Changes in BenefitsThere have been no premium changes due to benefit changes in this filing.Administrative CostsGolden Rule Insurance Company works to directly control administrative expenses by adopting better processes and technology, and through the development of programs and innovations that make health care more affordable. We have led the marketplace by introducing key innovations that make health care services more accessible and affordable for customers, improve the quality and coordination of health care services, and help individuals and their physicians make more informed health care decisions.Additionally, Golden Rule indirectly controls medical cost payments by using appropriate payment structures with providers and facilities. Golden Rule&rsquo;s goal is to control costs, maximize efficiency, and work closely with physicians and providers to obtain the best value and coverage.In addition, increases in State and Federal government imposed taxation and fees are another significant factor that impacts health care spending.These fees include new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) taxes and fees which will increase health insurance costs and need to be reflected in premium.  The two largest cost impacts both take effect with calendar year 2014 earned premiums:-Insurer Fee: UnitedHealthcare (parent company of Golden Rule) estimates 2014 premium will need to be increased by 1.625% to cover this fee and the associated additional federal income tax.-Reinsurance Fee: UnitedHealthcare estimates 2014 premium will need to be increased by 2.4%.A review of the current Golden Rule premium rate indicates that the rate is not sufficient to cover the projected benefit and administrative costs. The requested rate increase is anticipated to be sufficient to cover the projected benefit and administrative costs over the period beginning September 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014.",Review Complete,18.30,51984WI015,Gen 25,Golden Rule Insurance Company,Wisconsin,WI,Annual,18.30,18.30,RC

The calculated rate increase for the future rating period is 5.2%.For Blue TransitionsGroup Conversion products, the base period of January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 had incurred claims of $1,732,198 and premium of $1,234,127. The loss ratio for the experience period was 140.4%. These products are at the top of the rating band range as prescribed by South Dakota regulation. Thus, the increase for these products will be the same as on the Blue Select products, which is 5.2%.For South Dakota Farm Bureau products, the base period of January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 had incurred claims of $590,776 and premium of $589,368. The loss ratio for the experience period was 100.2%. These products are at the top of the rating band range as prescribed by South Dakota regulation. Thus, the increase for these products will be the same as on the Blue Select products, which is 5.2%.Changes in Medical Service CostsAnnual trend of 8.0% was used to project claims from the experience period into the rating period. This trend assumption includes any change in service costs and utilization. Due to natural fluctuations in claims amounts within a relatively smaller book of business, multi-year trend averages were reviewed to arrive at the assumed trend amount.Changes in BenefitsBenefits for all products within this filing remained relatively stable from the base period, so no adjustments were made.Administrative Costs and Anticipated ProfitsWhile Wellmark administrative costs in aggregate have decreased as a percent of premium from the prior rating period, additional ACArelated fees and impacts will now have to be factored into the premiums. The impact of these additional costs is about 4.8%. Wellmark&rsquo;s anticipated profit in South Dakota is changing from 3.5% in our last filing to 3.3% in this filing. This nominal margin is needed to help ensure Wellmark&rsquo;s longterm viability.Note  This filing is limited to existing Non-Grandfathered and Grandfathered individual plans currently in the market.  The URRT and Actuarial Memorandum  submitted for this filing require information designed for use in monitoring of the ACA market reforms, including compliance with the single risk pool requirement for newly issued plans.  These plans are not, and will never be considered part of the single risk pool with ACA plans, therefore some fields and data entered in the URRT ma not be useful for the intended purpose.    Nevertheless we have submitted the required Parts I, II, and III to the South Dakota Insurance Division and CMS pursuant to 45 C.F.R. 154.200, because the South Dakota Insurance Division, which has an effective rate review process, will be required to submit its findings to CMS using the format shown in Part I, II, and III, of the Rate Filing Justification.",Review Complete,17.40,50305SD009,Blue Transitions,Wellmark of South Dakota,South Dakota,SD,Annual,17.40,17.40,RC

The average increase will be approximately 18% and will vary somewhat by plan due to the way medical inflation is amplified or dampened by plan parameters such as deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums.2) Key Drivers of IncreaseThe main drivers of the requested 18% rate increase are medical inflation (approximately 8%), experience worse than that expected in previous pricing (approximately 10%), deductible leveraging (approximately 2%) and plan indexing (approximately -1%, more detail in the next section).Analysis of this block of business indicated a 10% increase for experience worse than expected. Due to the low volume of data available and in order to reduce the impact to policyholders, this was limited to 7.5%.3) Change in BenefitsAll MIC long-term contracts include a provision for indexing of deductibles and out-of-pocket (OOP) maximums in order to observe Federal HSA indexing requirements for HSA compatible plans and to minimize the need for future rate increases on the remainder of the long-term portfolio.  The rate increase includes approximately -1% for the indexing of deductible and out-of-pocket maximums.No other benefit changes are being made.3) Administrative Costs and Anticipated ProfitsThe main drivers of our administrative expenses are employee salaries and benefits, agent commissions, claim processing, and premium taxes, licenses and fees.

This is an increase of $419.45 from the average current rate. There is estimated to be 1 customer impacted by this rate increase over the course of next year.The premium increase to the one existing customer will be 53.5%. The rate increase is mostly driven by the impact of trend, aging and changes that had to be made to ensure compliance with ACA regulations.Currently rates for the Individual Conversion Plans in Indiana vary by several age bands. However, rates are being updated to ensure compliance with ACA regulations which includes being compliant with the federally designated age slope. Therefore, on average, individuals younger than 20 would expect to see rate decreases while other individuals are expected to see rate increases versus the current rates.Financial Experience of Connecticut General Life Insurance Company Individual Conversion Products:For the experience period, Cigna only had one member on its Indiana Individual conversion plan, and does not believe its past experience to be credible.How Legally Required Benefit Changes contribute to the rate increase:Benefit changes in order to comply with ACA regulations have contributed 20% of the rate increase. These changes include the addition of essential health benefits, restrictions on the out of pocket max, and adjustments to meet actuarial value requirements.How administrative costs&amp; anticipated profits contribute to the rate increase:In addition to the cost of medical services, there are a number of indirect medical and non-medical costs that an insurance company has to pay. These costs are as a result of programs that promote the best level of care and health for a patient, payments that must be made to federal, state or local government authorities in the form of taxes or fees, assessments or subsidies that states charge to pay for public health programs, e.g. childhood vaccines, financial examinations by the government, prevention of healthcare fraud, payments to agents or brokers who help customers enroll in a health plan and other costs that all businesses have such as employees&rsquo; salaries, building upkeep, utilities, etc.There are new fees as a result of ACA regulations that contribute to the overall increase.

The State's review was concentrated on compliance of the issuer's rate increase request with Idaho laws and regulations and also included fulfillment of the process for the review of unreasonable rate increases established under Section 2794 of the Public Health Service Act.The health trend for this filing is an assumption of 10.3% annually, which PacificSource has justified with a trend analysis.The remaining increase is due to worse than expected claims costs, which are projected to continue, additional federal fees, and morbidity assumption changes. We reviewed the data and assumptions that PacificSource used in determining this adjustment and found them not unreasonable. The company's projected risk margin upon implementing this increase is 3.0%.With this rate increase, the company expects to pay 81.4% of premium collected as claims.  This exceeds the federal minimum loss ratio requirements of 80%.",Not Applicable,"This filing requests an average year over year increase of 10.4% over the rates approved in our 2014 Idaho Small Group filing. The proposed rates are based on PacificSource's historical Idaho Small Group claims experience adjusted for PacificSource's historical average risk and demographics compared to the market average risk and demographics, expected medical trend, expected change in market morbidity from 2013 (experience period) to 2015 (projection period), changes in benefits, and expected state and federal reinsurance recoveries. The proposed rates also reflect changes in the taxes and fees imposed on health insurers for 2015. The increase in rates from 2014 to 2015 is primarily driven by deteriorating experience, trend, and changes in morbidity assumptions. PacificSource's Idaho Small Group PMPM claims grew by approximately 17% from 2012 to 2013, the experience bases for the 2014 and 2015 filings, respectively. The combined medical and pharmacy annual trend used to in this filing to project claims from 2013 to 2015 is 10.3%, which reflects expected changes in costs, changes in utilization, and the impact of leveraging. With access to more current data and using a revised methodology, the overall increase in morbidity from PacificSource pre&#8208;ACA experience to post&#8208;ACA market experience is greater than originally projected in our 2014 filing. Over 2013, the Idaho Small Group block earned $33.4 million in premium and incurred an estimated $34.4 million in claims, for a medical claims rate of 103.1%. Combined administrative expenses, commissions, taxes, and assessments were approximately 18.6% of premium, meaning the total expenses were approximately 121.7% of premium. PacificSource projects that the Idaho Small Group block will earn $36.9 million in premium in 2015 and incur approximately $30.1 million in claims, for a medical claims rate of 81.4%.

OVERVIEWThe rates being sought contain a zero percent operating margin for the health plan despite the health plan reporting operating losses in 2013 and a forecasted significant operating loss in 2014. The proposed rate adjustment is based on the need to adjust prospectively from the state&rsquo;s reduction of rates by 6.3% on small group qualified health plans and by 4.0% on individual qualified health plans for 2014, an increasing medical cost trend, and changes in the health insurance market driven by federal and state actions. Other contributing factors for the proposed 2015 rate adjustment include increases in fees, taxes and added coverage for new mandated benefits.Excellus Health Plan and related companies (EHP) provide health insurance and administrative services for about 1.8 million upstate New Yorkers in 39 counties. The proposed premium rates affect about 182,000 members or 10% of the health plan&rsquo;s total membership. Its proposed rates are subject to review by the New York Department of Financial Services pursuant to section 4308c of the New York Insurance Law. The Department may approve the proposed rate increase as requested, modify the proposed rate increase, or disapprove the proposed rate increase in its entirety. The determination by the Department shall be supported by sound actuarial assumptions and methods.The rate application will be filed with the Department on or about June 13, 2014. The actual rate increases approved by the Department will be communicated to the impacted parties at least 60 days prior to the date the new rate is implemented for the subscriber. EHP policyholders with renewal dates during 2015 would, if approved, receive the indicated rate adjustments on their next anniversary date on or after January 1, 2015.Excellus Health Plan is required by New York State law to develop rates that assume that at least 82% of premium revenue will be spent on health care costs in the direct pay market along with small groups, be actuarially sound, cover all claim costs, and provide a contribution to ensure adequate reserves. The percent of premium attributable to claims is referred to as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).Excellus Health Plan's MLR has been and continues to exceed the statutory minimums. In 2013, the MLR for Excellus Health Plan was 94.2% for individual direct pay and 91.0% for small groups. Under new reporting requirements for 2014, the three-year cumulative MLR is 94.4% for individual direct pay and 91.5% for small group qualified health plans. With the proposed rate adjustments, Excellus Health Plan's MLRs would remain well above the minimum levels. In the event the MLR falls below the required minimum, the health plan refunds any difference to policyholders.Periodic rate adjustments are necessary to secure the ability of Excellus Health Plan, or any insurer, to produce sufficient revenue and surplus for reserves to assure continued coverage and claim payments both for current health care needs, and potential catastrophic cost situations. Excellus Health Plan's reserves vary from year to year based on actual health care costs incurred. As of Dec. 31, 2013, the health plan had reserves equivalent to 2.5 months of claims and operating expense, and more than the minimum required by New York State law. These reserves are the insurance that assures payment even when costs run higher than anticipated, or emergencies or disasters occur, and should not be used as an alternative fund to temporarily reduce rate adjustments.In filing its rate application, Excellus Health Plan is sensitive to the fact that individuals and small businesses struggle to afford higher premiums. However, it is clear that an increase in premiums is necessary to assure the continued operations of the Plan and the viability of its product offerings. Because EHP already has a high MLR, failure to approve these rates would only lead to the need for even greater rate increases in the future as claim costs would eventually exceed premiums collected.II. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASEEscalating health care costsThe cost of health care services, equipment and products continues to be the primary reason for rate increases.Trend is a very important consideration in determining the need for a premium rate adjustment. Upstate New York is not immune to national trends in health care costs given our state&rsquo;s population and demographics. Industry experts such as Segal Consulting and Buck Consultants are forecasting a 7.2-10.4% medical benefit trend nationwide for 2014. EHP is forecasting an overall medical benefit trend factor for its commercial fully insured business of 6.8% for 2014-2015. The trend forecast takes into account projected increases in costs attributed to what Excellus Health Plan pays out in claims expenses for hospital inpatient and outpatient care, professional services, pharmacy benefits and other goods and services. The health plan&rsquo;s anticipated changes in medical benefit spending are summarized as follows:Hospital inpatient, 6.9%Hospital outpatient, 6.4%Professional services, 4.5%Pharmacy, 10.6%Other medical goods and services, 7.5%These trends do not include adjustments to base rates for previous rate increases that were insufficient to cover claims and operating expenses for some plan options.Health care costs for each of those benefit components take into account the compounding effects of both the price of the goods or services provided as well as the quantity of the goods and services consumed.The impact that each trend has to the overall cost of coverage is related to proportionate size of the benefit component. For example, overall spending would rise faster as a result of a 5% increase in professional services versus a 5% increase in drug costs because professional services represents a larger share of medical benefit spending.III. NEW YORK TAXES AND ASSESSMENTSInsurance taxes are built into the costs of health coverage. New Yorkers who voluntarily purchase private health insurance coverage paid more than $4 billion in state health taxes in 2011, according to an analysis by the New York State Conference of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans.New York&rsquo;s Health Care Reform Act of 1996 (HCRA) created two surcharges on health insurance and an additional tax is imposed under Section 206 (formerly Section 332) of the state Insurance Law.The covered lives assessment is an annual flat surcharge or tax on every person who has insurance coverage in the state. Health plans are assessed on the basis of the number of people they cover with individual and family rates that vary depending on the residence of the insured. Among upstate regions defined by the state, the annual covered lives assessment rates in 2014 that impact Excellus Health Plan members are as follows:Per Certificate Per Year by region (Individual : Family)Western: $39.40: $130.03Rochester: $105.72: $348.87Central: $55.59: $183.46Utica-Watertown: $8.54: $28.17Northeastern: $39.94: $131.79The second surcharge created by the 1996 Health Care Reform Act is collected from health plans in the form of a sales tax on many hospital-related services. The surcharge is applied to both self-insured and fully insured plans. Beginning at 8.18% in 1997, the surcharge is now at 9.63%.The third levy, the Section 206 assessment, was originally established to finance New York State Department of Insurance operations but its funding purposes have expanded beyond that purpose. The assessments apply to all licensed insurers in the state (e.g. life, property and casualty, and health), and are based on New York premiums.In total, the above New York taxes and assessments including Section 206 aggregated to nearly 6% of the 2015 small group and individual qualified health plans&rsquo; premium.IV. FEDERAL TAXES, MANDATES AND ADJUSTMENTSAnnual fee on health insurance providers:Beginning in 2014, this fee is based on each health insurance company&rsquo;s market share of net premiums written, adjusted for size and corporate structure.The federal law requires the total fee on nationwide health insurance providers to be collected is:$8 billion in 2014,$11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016,$13.9 billion in 2017, and$14.3 billion in 2018.After 2018, the fee is expected to collect $14.3 billion, indexed to the rate of growth in premiums.Each year, the calculation will be based on the market share of each assessed plan and will change based on the number of companies in the insured market. Under this fee provision, a health plan could incur financial losses but would still be subject to the market share fee.For EHP, this fee increase represents a 1.2% increase to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans for 2015.Risk Adjustment Program:The risk adjustment program is a permanent provision that applies to both the individual and small group insurance market. This federal program assesses a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and uses the revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members.A fee of $0.96 per member per year is collected to fund the risk adjustment program. For EHP, this program reduces small group qualified health plans&rsquo; premiums by about 1.5%. For 2015, this program has no impact on the premium of individual direct pay qualified health plans.Transitional reinsurance program for the individual market:The federal law created a temporary reinsurance program that is to collect nationwide:$10 billion in 2014,$6 billion in 2015, and$4 billion in 2016.Additionally, a separate contribution is to be deposited into the U.S. Treasury that will total $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016.The contribution rate is to be based on a $44 national per capita yearly amount in 2015. All insurers and self- insured group health plans are required to contribute on behalf of all group health plans and health insurance coverage they provide. For EHP, this fee represents about 1% of premium but it is about 40% less than last year resulting in a 0.5% decrease to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans in 2015.For the individual qualified health plans, the federal government established reinsurance for excessive claims. The amount of money being distributed in 2014 is being reduced in 2015. At the same time, this reduction will require a 3.8% premium increase for individual qualified health plans.Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) fee:The federal law created the PCORI to help stakeholders make informed health decisions by advancing the quality and relevance of evidence-based medicine through the use of comparative clinical effectiveness research findings. The fee is set at $2 per year multiplied by the average number of lives covered under the plan for plan years ending before October 1, 2014. And, for plan years ending on or after October 1, 2014, the fee increases based on the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures.Federal mental health mandateThe federal requirements for coverage of mental health parity require a 0.2% increase to current premium to pay for required benefits in 2015.V. OPERATING EXPENSE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTSA portion of what is reported to the state as administrative expenses is attributed to what Federal Health Reform considers quality improvement expenses, meaning the federal government recognizes that these represent costs that lead to overall improvements in health care versus simply a routine business expense, and as a result will be considered a medical benefit expense for purposes of federal MLR calculations.Those quality improvement expenses include such items as:-Improvements in health outcomes brought about by case management and disease management programs,-Actions taken to help prevent hospital readmissions through such things as discharge planning and counseling,-Wellness and community health promotional activities, and-Health information technology that is used to help measure clinical effectiveness and predictive modeling.The proposed rates will more accurately reflect the true operating expense of administering the federal Health Care Reform legislation through the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange. The changes in the health insurance market required building and implementing an entirely new sales channel from what had primarily been a business-to-business marketplace.This required:-The implementation of a new sales call center that saw extended open enrollment deadlines in 2014,-The hiring of additional staff,-Increased direct-to-consumer communication costs to educate consumers about new products and how to access those products, and-The building and implementation of new products, new infrastructure for the continued improvements and changes to the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange and for the implementation of additional mandates for the federal Health Care Reform.Operating expenses - including quality improvement initiatives but excluding federal and state taxes, fees and assessments, and broker commissions - represent 8.7% of premium in small group qualified health plans and 8.4% in individual qualified health plans.VI. REGULATION 146Regulation 146 was a market stabilization mechanism for the individual and small group pools that was in effect prior to the adoption of the ACA. Similar to the ACA Risk Adjustment program, Reg. 146 attempted to equalize the risk within the small group and individual markets by assessing a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and used this revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members. Because of the redundancy with the new risk adjustment program, Reg. 146 is being phased out. The Department of Financial Services is requiring plans to distribute all outstanding compensations through premium adjustments in 2015 and 2016. This distribution plan results in a reduction in the small group qualified health plan premium of 0.3% and in individual premium of about 1%.",Review Complete,12.20,78124NY100,Excellus PPO HDHP,"Excellus Health Plan, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Quarterly,16.71,16.71,RC

(NAIC code number 55107) has applied to the Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services to adjust premium rates for its community-rated small group and individual qualified health plans.I. OVERVIEWThe rates being sought contain a zero percent operating margin for the health plan despite the health plan reporting operating losses in 2013 and a forecasted significant operating loss in 2014. The proposed rate adjustment is based on the need to adjust prospectively from the state&rsquo;s reduction of rates by 6.3% on small group qualified health plans and by 4.0% on individual qualified health plans for 2014, an increasing medical cost trend, and changes in the health insurance market driven by federal and state actions. Other contributing factors for the proposed 2015 rate adjustment include increases in fees, taxes and added coverage for new mandated benefits.Excellus Health Plan and related companies (EHP) provide health insurance and administrative services for about 1.8 million upstate New Yorkers in 39 counties. The proposed premium rates affect about 182,000 members or 10% of the health plan&rsquo;s total membership. Its proposed rates are subject to review by the New York Department of Financial Services pursuant to section 4308c of the New York Insurance Law. The Department may approve the proposed rate increase as requested, modify the proposed rate increase, or disapprove the proposed rate increase in its entirety. The determination by the Department shall be supported by sound actuarial assumptions and methods.The rate application will be filed with the Department on or about June 13, 2014. The actual rate increases approved by the Department will be communicated to the impacted parties at least 60 days prior to the date the new rate is implemented for the subscriber.

The main components of the requested increase are:1.	Higher than anticipated morbidity&ndash; 9%2.	Increases in the underlying medical costs (trend)&ndash; 9%3.	Reduction in the anticipated Affordable Care Act (ACA) Reinsurance Recoveries&ndash; 1%The filing was initially submitted on June 27, 2014, and will be subject to the requirements of the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance Regulations and the ACA. BCBSTN anticipates that 78% of its policies will be sold On Exchange.In support of their request, BCBSTN has provided premium rates, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template, a Part II Written Explanation of The Rate Increase, and a Part III Actuarial Memorandum. The actuarial memorandum included, inter alia, actuarial assumptions, anticipated loss ratios, other information required by the ACA and appropriate actuarial certifications.INS has reviewed the submission in its entirety. However, INS has given special consideration in its review to the details of the Company&rsquo;s Part III Actuarial Memorandum, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template and the characteristics of the rating elements subject to the Federal regulations prescribed in 45CFR Part 147 paragraph 147.102.  Based on that review, INS has come to the following key conclusions:URRT Section 1 Experience Period Data&bull;	Earned premiums, incurred claims, allowed claims and index rate per member per month (PMPM) for the experience period, January 2013 through December 2013, appear reasonable,&bull;	The completion method used to determine estimated incurred claims and allowed claims is consistent with accepted actuarial methods,&bull;	BCBSTN does not anticipate having a MLR rebate based on its 2013 experience,&bull;	Member months for the Experience Period, 709,013 is expected to increase to 2,825,484 for the Projection Period. The company anticipates the large increase because:1.	BCBSTN believes a large number of previously uninsured individuals will enter the marketplace2.	BCBSTN expects to retain their large market share in Tennessee.URRT Section II Allowed Claims, PMPM Basis&bull;	Benefit Category descriptions closely follow the preferred descriptions of the URRT instructions&bull;	The utilization per 1,000 and the average cost/service factors by benefit category for the Experience Period appear to be reasonable for the Individual market&bull;	The total allowed PMPM claim cost of $227.28 (Section II) matches the index rate of $227.00 (Section I) for the experience period (difference due to rounding)&bull;	The overall Trend assumption is 9.0%. Based on the narrative provided by the company, the trend assumption appears to be reasonable.&bull;	BCBSTN used a&lsquo;Population Risk Morbidity&rsquo; factor of 1.151 to project their underlying experience. The expected increase in morbidity is due to:1.	The expected higher morbidity of new entrants2.	The elimination of pre-existing conditionsBased on the narrative and spreadsheet provided by the company, INS believes the 1.151 Morbidity factor to be reasonable&bull;	The&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factor used by BCBSTN to project their underlying experience was set to 1.145. The main drivers behind this factor were:1.	An increase in the average age of the insureds2.	Additional benefits to meet the Essential Health Benefit (EHB)3.	Normalization of the Medical Plan and Prescription Drug NetworksBased on the narrative and spreadsheet provided by the company, INS believes the 1.145&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factor to be reasonable.URRT Section II Credibility Manual&bull;	BCBSTN used its Small Group projection for its Individual Credibility Manual, without any adjustments. The company believes that the guaranteed issue nature of their Small Group policies will be similar to the ACA required guaranteed issue rules for Individual policies.URRT Section III Projected Experience&bull;	BCBSTN&rsquo;s&lsquo;Projected Allowed Experience Claims PMPM&rsquo; is based 80% on its projected actual experience and 20% on its Credibility Manual.  The company expects that 20% of its 2015 Individual membership will be coming from the Small Group market, the basis of its Credibility Manual&bull;	The method used to determine the&lsquo;Paid to Allowed Average Factor in the Projection Period&rsquo; of 69.6% is actuarially acceptable and such average factor is consistent with the&lsquo;paid to allowed&rsquo; ratios at the plan level&bull;	Companies are allowed to make a Risk Adjustment in developing its incurred claims on the URRT. Risk adjustment calculates a risk score for each plan participant, based upon age, sex and diagnosis. This is used to calculate the company&rsquo;s Plan average risk score. If the Plan average risk score is higher than the average risk score for the state, the Company will receive payment for having a higher risk population. Because BCBSTN anticipates its market level risk scores to be consistent with the Tennessee market, its Risk Adjustment is 0.

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 14.4%.Who is affected?The 2015 rates will apply to policies from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 10,500 members currently are enrolled in plans that will renew on these 2015 plans.What are the major factors driving the rate level?Medical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up around 8%, excluding the effect of benefit changes. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.We have also updated our assumptions around the Affordable Care Act (ACA) required taxes and fees.How will premiums change?The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the subscriber chooses, the number and ages of family members, where in Virginia the subscriber is located, and which family members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complied with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&bull; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access My Online Services, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services. Additionally, Aetna&rsquo;s Plan for Your Health website aims to educate all consumers, not just Coventry and Aetna members, on how to take advantage of their health care benefits.",Review Complete,14.43,99663VA014,CoventryOne POS,"Coventry Health Care of Virginia, Inc",VIRGINIA,VA,Annual,14.43,14.43,RC

We reviewed the data and assumptions that PacificSource used in determining this adjustment and found them not unreasonable. The company's projected risk margin upon implementing this increase is 3.0%.With this rate increase, the company expects to pay 79.5% of premium collected as claims.  After allowable adjustments, this meets or exceeds the federal minimum loss ratio requirements of 80%.",Not Applicable,"This filing requests an aggregate increase of 36.9% over the rates approved in our 2014 Idaho Individual filing. The proposed rates are basedon PacificSource's historical Idaho Individual claims experience adjusted for PacificSource's historical average risk and demographics comparedto the market average risk and demographics, expected medical trend, expected change in market morbidity from 2013 (experience period) to2015 (projection period), changes in benefits, and expected state and federal reinsurance recoveries. The proposed rates also reflect changes inthe taxes and fees imposed on health insurers for 2015.The increase in rates from 2014 to 2015 is primarily driven by deteriorating experience, trend, changes in morbidity assumptions, and reducedreinsurance recoveries. PacificSource's Idaho Individual PMPM claims grew by approximately 18% from 2012 to 2013, the experience bases forthe 2014 and 2015 filings, respectively. The combined medical and pharmacy annual trend used in this filing to project claims from 2013 to 2015is 10.9%, which reflects expected changes in costs, changes in utilization, and the impact of leveraging.

Lower cost small groups are expected to remain outside the ACA single-risk pool due to more favorable premium rates afforded to them in the pre-ACA rating formula.  The remaining population expected to enroll in the ACA qualifying products represents a small portion of the pool, and those groups generally have unfavorable demographics and higher than average costs.Historical Financial Experience:The historical experience is for Highmark&rsquo;s subsidiary HHIC.

Scope and Range of the Rate IncreaseCF is proposing to raise premiums by 15.0% on average, prior to age band changes.  The range is 5.4% to 21.0%. For renewing customers, an age band change adds 2.6% to the renewal, on average, with a range of 0.0% to 4.7% for ages 22 and upwards per the CMS age curve.2. Financial Experience of the ProductThe products in this filing were first launched on 1-1-14, and therefore have no experience in the 2013 experience period.  The closed non-grandfathered products from 2013, upon which these rates were based, had total premiums and allowed claims for the incurred period of 1-1-13 through 12-31-13 of $6,355,681 and $7,029,573.The primary factors driving this proposed change in premium rates are:a) Projected significant increase in membership volumes with average morbidities higher than 2014.  CareFirst estimates a morbidity risk factor of 1.35 for 2015.    The morbidity risk factor projections are based upon the model that supported CareFirst&rsquo;s 2014 rate filings.  The model compares known and estimated allowed claims costs per member per month (PMPM) for 2013 to project the costs of various categories of the estimated 2015 membership.b) An aging of the pool of members.  The age of HMO members changed dramatically by increasing 9.3 years, from 27.9 to 37.2.c) An increase in the cost of medical care delivery in the form of claims trend driven by increases in both unit cost and utilization.  See description in section 3.d) An increase in the Health Insurer Fee.  See description in section 4.Our projected DICR for MLR purposes is 83.7%, meeting the 80.0% minimum of Public Health Service Act (PHSA) 218.3. Changes in Medical Service CostsThe proposed trend of 9.0% is a reduction of 200 basis points from 2014&rsquo;s 11.0%.4. Changes in BenefitsAdjustments have been made for pediatric dental, mandatory generics, a new Hepatitis C prescription drug called Sovaldi and maternity.CF is proposing to introduce an incentive program (IP) whereby members can earn medical expense debit cards of as much as $250 annually, for an individual ($650 for a family). The cards must be utilized for qualified medical expenses such as deductibles, copays and out-of-pocket costs. The scope includes all benefit plans within CF&rsquo;s portfolio, On and Off the Exchange. This is being done in a revenue-neutral way.Retail Clinics such as urgent care centers will have reduced copays to match the PCP rather than specialist copay with a negligible price impact.For the Young Adult-Catastrophic plan, the deductible-out-of-pocket maximum has been raised from $6,350 to $6,600.A 5-tiered structure (Generics-Preferred, Generics-Non-Preferred, Brand Name-Preferred, Brand Name-Non-Preferred, Specialty) is currently used for approximately 20% of our benefits. This is changing to a 4-tier structure by collapsing the Generics tiers.Included in this calculation are decreases to claims costs for 1) a change in our Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) in 2014 and 2) a reduction in our fee schedule for out-of-network (OON) utilization for HMO-based products that have an OON option (a.k.a., NP3).5.

Scope and Range of the Rate IncreaseDenver Health Medical Plan, Inc. (DHMP) is increasing premium rates for individual Elevate Basic plans by 18.4% and Elevate Expanded plans by 14.3%. A subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate could be higher or lower depending on the benefit plan selected, age of the subscriber, and dependent coverage. There are 658 members in these products as of May 1, 2014, who are affected by the increase.2.	Financial ExperienceThese products were both introduced in 2014, and so as of the time of this rate request, there is only a limited amount of experience data available. Rates for 2015 continue to be based on external claims data sources from prior to 2014, adjusted for differences in the post-ACA individual insurance market.It typically takes several months to get a complete view of healthcare costs due to delays in receiving medical claims from healthcare providers. Prescription drug claims usually become available much faster. As of April 10, 2014, DHMP has paid approximately $225,000 in prescription drug claims for Elevate members, representing an average monthly claim cost of approximately $257 per member per month (PMPM). This prescription drug claim level is much higher than was expected when 2014 rates were developed. Under the ACA, premiums are set based on the expected health status of the entire market, not of DHMP&rsquo;s own enrollees&ndash; so high costs for DHMP do not directly translate into rate increases.The proposed rate increase is expected to produce a medical loss ratio (MLR) of 83.5%. It should be noted that the projected MLR meets the minimum requirement of 80.0% as defined in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). If the actual MLR were to fall below this level (such as if actual claim costs turn out to be lower than expected), DHMP would pay rebates to members as required by the ACA.3.	Changes in Medical CostsThe primary drivers of the components of the proposed rate increases are associated with higher utilization of inpatient, outpatient, and professional services, and prescription drugs. Healthcare providers and drug makers have, for many years, increased prices faster than the general rate of inflation. This directly affects health insurance premiums. Also, the rate with which services are utilized has also been increasing. This increase is partially offset by more favorable contracts DHMP has negotiated with its provider network.The enrolled population in 2014 is significantly older, on average, than was projected. For example, DHMP enrolled relatively few children, and the adults had a much higher average age than expected. Published data suggest that this was true for many insurers selling coverage on Colorado&rsquo;s exchange. Healthcare costs, on average, increase with age. The ACA does not allow adult premiums to vary by more than a 3-to-1 ratio based on age, even though the variation in costs due to age is wider than 3-to-1. This regulatory requirement to&ldquo;compress&rdquo; premiums across different ages results in higher rates overall when the average age of the population increases, particularly for younger adults.The federal Transitional Reinsurance program provided a significant amount of premium reduction to the individual market in 2014. The ACA specifies that this reduction will decline in 2015 (it will decline in further in 2016 and be eliminated entirely in 2017).4.	Changes in BenefitsBenefits are changing only slightly. As approved by the Colorado Division of Insurance (SERFF tracking number DVHH-129467559), copays for specialty and non-preferred branded prescription drugs will be changing to a deductibleandcoinsurance structure. This change offsets a portion of the rate increase.Because nearly all benefits are remaining the same, and because these benefits include fixed-dollar deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket maximum,&ldquo;leveraging&rdquo; causes premiums to rise faster than claims. This is because member cost sharing becomes a progressively smaller portion of total claims when deductibles, copayments, and out-of-pocket limits do not increase.5.	Administrative Costs and Anticipated Provision for Profit and ContingenciesWe are proposing no change to DHMP&rsquo;s provision for profit and contingencies.There has been no proposed increase in DHMP&rsquo;s allowance for general overhead expense. The only expense assumptions that have changed for 2015 are:&bull;	A slight increase due to higher reinsurance costs (this refers to reinsurance coverage purchased by DHMP, not the ACA&rsquo;s transitional reinsurance program)&bull;	An increase due to higher costs associated with internal personnel and external brokers involved with assisting new members with signing up for coverage",Review Complete,18.32,66699CO003,Elevate (S),"Denver Health Medical Plan, Inc",COLORADO,CO,Annual,18.32,18.32,RC

Under Maryland law, rates may not be inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or excessive in relation to benefits.  Each rate filing is reviewed on its own merits.  The Commissioner&rsquo;s rate decisions must be based on statistical analysis and reasonable assumptions.  To assist the Commissioner in making these decisions, Maryland Insurance Administration (&ldquo;MIA&rdquo;) actuaries examine the data, methods and assumptions used by each insurer, non-profit health service plan, or HMO (&ldquo;carrier&rdquo;).  They review numerous factors related to proposed premium rates, including the carrier&rsquo;s actual and projected claims experience, medical and prescription costs, administrative costs, and profits or losses.  The Commissioner also considers the impact premium rates will have on Maryland consumers.  Under the federal Affordable Care Act and Maryland law, in the individual and small group markets, 80 cents of every premium dollar must be spent on paying claims or on quality improvement activities that figure increases to 85 cents in the large group market.  If an insurance carrier does not meet these targets, the carrier must pay rebates to policyholders.Considerations and Modifications to Requested Premium RatesCoventry Health Care of Delaware, Inc. requested a 13.3% rate increase, on average, for its small group HMO product. The proposed increase was due, in part, to combining Coventry Health Care of Delaware, Inc. (&ldquo;Coventry&rdquo;) and Aetna Health, Inc.&rsquo;s (&ldquo;Aetna&rdquo;) experience for rate development purposes.  In the company&rsquo;s 2014 rate filing, it used only its own experience to develop the rates as the company considered Coventry experience alone to be fully credible.During the rate review process, the MIA concluded that Coventry&rsquo;s experience alone is fully credible for this year&rsquo;s rate filing as was the case for last year.  Given the membership levels of Aetna and Coventry, the differences in providers between Aetna&rsquo;s and Coventry&rsquo;s networks, the differences in the plans available for purchase, the relationship of the 2014 Coventry claims experience versus the 2014 Aetna claims experience, and the impact the requested rate increase would have upon Maryland members currently enrolled in the product, the MIA required the Company to consider only Coventry experience for rate development purposes. The modification resulted in an approximate 4.2% reduction in the company&rsquo;s proposed first quarter premium rates for 2015.As modified during the rate review process, Coventry Health Care of Delaware, Inc.&rsquo;s premium rates for first quarter 2015 reflect an approximate 8.5% increase as compared with its premium rates for first quarter 2014.Final DeterminationPursuant to&sect; 11-603(c)(2) of the Insurance Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, the Commissioner has determined that the Company&rsquo;s requested premium rates, as modified during the rate review process, are not inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.",Not Applicable,"SummaryCoventry is filing rates for Small Group plans in Maryland. This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 9.83%.Who is affected?The new rates will apply to policies that start from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 7,700 members currently are enrolled in plans that will no longer be available due to ACA provisions. These members will have the option to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.What are the major factors driving the rate level?Medical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up around 7%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.In addition to increasing medical costs, we are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes increased expected medical costs by an average of 6.1%. We have also updated our assumptions around the Affordable Care Act (ACA) required taxes and fees.How will premiums change?Some premiums will increase and others will even go down. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling employees, where in Maryland the group is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business.

(Coventry HL) has proposed an increase of 11.6%, with  this amount varying across plans from between 0.9% and 18.6%. Rate changes were calculated by comparing current 2014 plans to the most similar 2015 plans. Coventry HL experience was considered fully credible, consequently the rate development is based exclusively on a projection of base period experience under this license. Coventry is also including in this filing a quarterly rate increase of 2.1%, based on an assumed annual trend of 8.6%.In the development of 2015 projected allowed claims Coventry HL assumes a trend level of 8.6% between the base period and the projection period. This is at the high end of what we have observed as pricing trend in the market, but not unreasonable.  The largest adjustment to experience is an 12.8% morbidity adjustment reflecting both an adjustment for the change in market morbidity and an adjustment of pre-ACA Coventry morbidity to market levels. In addition, Coventry applies a 3% adjustment to base period experience to reflect very favorable large claims experience in the base period. Additionally, Coventry HL included an adjustment of 1.4% to take into account benefit changes (the addition of essential health benefits), as well as geographic and network differences. Non-benefit expense loads were reduced in aggregate compared to the equivalent rate filing in 2014, with increases in taxes and fees more than offset by reductions in administrative expenses.The change in premium rates by plan is a consequence of a transition to an updated methodology, driven in part by the acquisition of Coventry by Aetna. The updated pricing models with updated large group claims experience data were used to estimate paid:allowed ratios. Utilization assumptions were also re-assessed, using an internal Aetna model of the impact of benefit design on utilization, calibrated using large group claims experience. This has resulted in utilization estimates changing relative to the HHS parameters used in prior years, with greater experience variation being attributed to benefit design.The issuer expects their Federal Minimum Loss Ratio to be 86%, above the minimum required threshold of 80%.They have provided the calculation and we find it reasonable.Coventry HL has provided sufficient support for their assumptions and rating methodology.

The remaining population expected to enroll in the ACA qualifying products represents a small portion of the pool, and those groups generally have unfavorable demographics and higher than average costs.Historical Financial Experience:Three-year financial experience for the HHIC Small Group segment is as follows:2013 Premium $892,423,0002013 Claims $802,561,0002013 Operating Results ($22,664,000)2013 Loss Ratio 89.9%2012 Premium $1,003,072,0002012 Claims $899,818,0002012 Operating Results ($15,687,000)2012 Loss Ratio 89.7%2011 Premium $1,086,460,0002011 Claims $933,662,0002011 Operating Results $34,798,0002011 Loss Ratio 85.9%Change in Medical Service Costs:While the 2013 experience for the non-grandfathered plans rose at a moderate 4.5%, the projected population is expected to add another 19.6% to the cost of medical care per member per month (PMPM).  This is relative to the assumptions used in the 2014 rate filing, which was submitted before the transitional policies were announced and assumed that all small groups would migrate to the ACA pool in 2014.  This is offset slightly by higher allowed demographic factors.Change in Benefits:No benefit changes are being proposed within this filing.Administrative Costs and Anticipated Operating Results:Relative to the 2014 rate filing, internal administrative costs remain essentially flat on a per member per month basis.  The Health Insurer Tax increases in 2015 by another 1.5% of premium.  The total administrative costs are lower, as a percent of premium, due to the higher projected claim costs.The anticipated operating results are not excessive or unreasonable.

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 12.6%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Fewer than 10 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included inthis filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 7.5%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer small groups in Oklahoma a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&bull;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&bull; Changes to required taxes and fees&bull; Changes to Benefit Requirements&bull; Restrictions on Underwriting practicesWill Premiums for All Small Group Plans Increase 12.6%?No, the 12.6% is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down, others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, the number of members (for family plans) and their ages, and where in Oklahoma the group is located.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of actions to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&bull; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.",Review Complete,12.62,76668OK005,OK Sm Grp Off Exchange,"Coventry Health Care of Kansas, Inc.",OKLAHOMA,OK,Annual,12.62,12.62,RC

Based on this review the Division concluded that the average 37.2 percent rate increase was justified and not unreasonable.  The requested rate increase was projected to be significantly less than needed in order to cover the projected cost of claims and expenses in Alaska in 2015 and in determining whether the requested rate increase was in compliance with federal and state rating laws, the Division did consider Premera&rsquo;s financial stability and strength to assure that it was sufficient to make good on its obligation to pay claims.Premera projects that their loss ratio for the individual insurance business will significantly exceed the federal minimum loss ratio of 80 percent and therefore anticipates no rebates will be paid.The rate changes will become effective on 1/1/2015.",Not Applicable,"Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield HHS Form Part IIProduct effective date January 1st 2015Individual Metallic ProductsPremera Blue Cross Blue Shield (Premera) is filing this rate change request to cover the annual cost increases which apply to our individual metallic products both in and out of the exchange in Alaska.Members affected by this filingPremera currently has 6,923 members on metallic plans. 5,013 of those members enrolled through the Healthcare.gov, the federal marketplace. The remaining 1,910 enrolled directly with Premera.Plan design and benefitsThese plans are designed to meet the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirements for actuarial value and Essential Health Benefits.  For 2015 we have added in network pediatric dental class 1 services to be covered in full on our gold plans.Rates and changes in costsWe are extremely concerned about the costs we are currently seeing in the Alaska market and the implications of these costs for the long term sustainability of individual healthcare coverage across the state.The implementation of the ACA has transformed the Alaska individual market. The combination of guaranteed access to coverage, the extension of non ACA compliant plans under transitional relief rules and a state with a comparatively small number of individual consumers may not be sustainable as currently structured.  Although the ACA includes some risk mitigation programs (reinsurance, risk adjustment and risk corridors) these are insufficient in a state that lacks an individual market which is large or stable enough to spread risk.The risk experience in the metallic plan risk pool is further influenced by the fact that 50 percent of the state&rsquo;s high risk pool (ACHIA) and 100 percent of the federal Preexisting Condition Insurance Pool have left those plans and have likely now purchased coverage in the individual market.  Premera may have obtained a disproportionate share of these individuals.Premera is committed to working with the Division of Insurance (DOI), the State, and the industry to develop and implement programs that will help to stabilize the market and keep costs affordable for individual consumers.   As a result, our 2015 rate filing is significantly lower than is needed to break even for our metallic lines of business. Programs such as a supplemental state re insurance program will spread high medical costs across the insured market and limit the need for large rate increases in the individual market in the future.For 2015 a 72.3 percent would be required for this line of business to break even. However, Premera is filing for an average rate increase of 37.2 percent across our individual metallic plans both on and off the exchange.  Based on this filing, rate increases could range from 35.2 percent to 40.2 percent.Key drivers of ratesThese rates are driven by two key factors:The extremely high claims costs that are being incurred by members on our metallic plans.The size and composition of the pool across which these claims costs are being spread.Claims costsBased on data from the first quarter of 2014, our claims costs per member, per month are running at $878, well over the $195 we spent per member, per month in 2013Just 15 new members have incurred $3.8 million between January 1st and April 30th in 2014.Pool size and compositionPrior to open enrollment we had anticipated that approximately 15,000 consumers would enroll in metallic plans. However, most likely as a result of problems with Healthcare.gov and the extension of nonmetallic plans under transitional relief, only 6,000 consumers enrolled.The demographic composition of those that did enroll in metallic plans was older and less healthy than anticipated.Just to break even, given the claims experience we are currently seeing, would require a 72.3 percent rate increase for our individual metallic plans for 2015. This rate increase breaks down as detailed below:Health condition of new enrollees, including from state and federal high risk pools: 56.68 percentReduction of federal re insurance: 7.8 percentIncrease in federal tax on insured health plans: 2.2 percentRemaining factors: 6.2 percent, specifically,4.7 percent for overall rising medical costs1.5 percent for additional fees and administrative costsWe do not want to pass on such a significant rate increase to our individual market consumers in Alaska.  As such we are filing for a 37.2 percent average rate increase for 2015, which includes a projected loss of $5 million for Premera.Expected use of the rate dollarPremera is committed to using our members&rsquo; rate dollar responsibly and consistently pays out a high percentage of the members&rsquo; rate dollar on medical claims. Given the current claims experience for this line of business and our projected losses in 2015, we expect to pay over 100percent of our members&rsquo; premium dollars toward medical claims for 2015, thus incurring a loss on this line of business. In addition to medical claims, the following costs will also be incurred:ACA related taxes and fees, including fees paid toward Healthcare.gov, account for 6.9percent of the rate dollar in 2015.Premera continues to focus on increasing efficiency and reducing our administrative expenses. These costs are expected to account for 6percent of the rate dollar in 2015.Commission to producers brokers is expected to account for 3percent of members&rsquo; premium dollar in 2015Financial experience of the product:2014 is the first year of experience for these products. Based on data through April 2014, Premera currently projects a $3.6 million loss serving individual market customers on metallic plans in 2014 without commercial reinsurance.Our estimates show that without a rate increase for 2015, these losses could increase to $37 million in 2015, based on a market of 12,000 members.

For example, the Transitional Policy that was announced by the Administration, first articulated in November 2013, and subsequently extended in March 2014, is projected to result in a more adverse population than assumed in the current rates because previously medically underwritten non-grandfathered members are allowed to remain in transitional plans.Medical Inflation, Trend, Combined effect of medical provider price increases, utilization changes, medical cost shifting, and new medical procedures and technology.Reinsurance Credit-Reduction in reinsurance coinsurance from 2014 to 2015.Addition of coverage for Essential Health Benefits i.e. Breast Pump expanded coverage, Oral Chemo Parity.An adjustment for additional prescription drugs that were added to the formulary, i.e. Solvadi and Olysio.Increase in Insurer Fee, PCORI, Exchange Fee, as a result of assumed increase in the proportion of on exchange revenue based on 2014 experience.Financial experience of the product. FHCP has only sold PPACA compliant plans in 2014.  FHCP does not have credible financial experience for these PPACA compliant plans.Changes in Medical Service Costs. FHCP medical costs have been increasing moderately.  This is in part due to the fact that FHCP is a hybrid of Staff Physicians and contracted FFS Physicians.  Also, FHCP owns and operates our own Pharmacies. Thus, low trend factors were used to project future PPACA plan medical costs.Changes in benefits.  FHCP has 33 Individual Product IDs.

For the benefit designsthat cannot be directly coded in the Federal AV calculator, claim distribution information provided in the Federal AV calculator was used to convert the benefit design into equivalent benefit designs that were coded in the Federal AV calculator.Based on our analysis this plan is in compliance with ACA rating requirements.b) Development of Base Period ExperienceRocky Mountain HMO has credible small group experience. The non-grandfathered experience from Rocky Mountain HMO product experience has been utilized for the development of the base rate.The experience period used for the projection is 1/1/2013 to 12/31/2013 paid through 4/30/2014 and is 100 percent credible. The experience period used in the projection includes 122,334 member months.We verified that the base period experience includes an estimate of IBNR based on historical claim lag averages to project future claims payments.c) Development of Trends1) Utilization Adjustment Trend Development and Application:The average annual increase in utilization is 2.2 percent, with a minimum of no trend for capitation utilization and a high of 3.5 percent increase in prescription drug service category.2) Unit Cost Adjustment Trend Development and Application:The average annual increase in unit cost is 3.8 percent, with a low of no increase in capitation utilization and a high of a 13.1 percent increase in prescription drug service category.3) Population Morbidity Adjustment Trend Development and Application:The single risk pool that will be insured is expected to be a much higher risk than the current insured population due to segmentation and selection resulting from transitional plan renewals offered in Colorado. The estimated impact is a 1 percent increase in morbidity in Colorado.4) Other Trend Development and Application:Costs were reviewed and trends were analyzed over the four year time period ending December 31, 2013.  Trend was normalized for age, geographic area, plan design, mix of business, and other factors. The plan sponsor is including a new drug Solvadi (Hepatitis C drug). Inclusion of Solvadi increases the pharmacy costs by 4.5 percent.Based on the historical analysis the proposed trend for the filing is 8.1 percent. This trend is comprised of a Medical total trend of 6.9 percent, including 2.3 percent for utilization and 3 percent for provider cost increase. The trend is also comprised of a Pharmaceutical total trend of 17.11 percent, including increases of 3.5 percent for utilization, 7.15 for provider cost, and 4.5 percent for the introduction of new drugs. In addition to account for the change in the age mix of the population an insurance trend of 1.5 percent was used.The cost and frequency of medical and pharmacy services continue to rise and prompt the need for a rate increase. The proposed trends for projection are within the normal range and are well supported by Rocky Mountain's historical experience.d) Development of Non Benefit ExpensesThe non-benefit expenses used in the projection are 19.5 percent of the premium and include:Commissions of 2.8 percentGeneral Expenses of 10.7 percentProfit and Contingencies of 4.2 percent (pre-tax)PPACA Fees of 3 percentInvestment Income of negative 1.2 percent.Administrative costs for medical benefits were developed at an aggregate level for all plans based on historical administrative cost PMPMs trended to 2015, taking into account any expected changes in costs.It is expected that Rocky Mountain HMO will continue to meet the requirements of the federally defined medical loss ratio.  The expense loading reflects the operating methods of the company and its anticipated expenses in Colorado.e) Development of Profit/Contingencies MarginThe proposed rate for profit and contingencies is 3.0 percent after tax, including investment income. The plan sponsor is including this profit margin to account for the probability of losses due to large claims.f) Development of Projected Loss RatiosTo develop the projected loss ratios, earned premium and incurred claims from the experience period (representing a blend of new and existing business) will be projected forward to the rating period using the trend, non-benefit, and profit assumptions as mentioned above.The premiums will be adjusted for member persistency and for historical experience whereas the claims for these policies will be adjusted using the trend specified in the trend section of this letter.Using the assumptions, the projected loss ratio for the product will be 80.5 percent which is inclusive of the PPACA taxes and fees in the premium.Total retention is estimated to be 19.5 percent with 10.7 percent attributable to general operating expenses, 3 percent attributable to PPACA fees, 2.8 percent for commissions, and 4.2 percent (pre-tax) for profit and contingencies, including investment income.g) How the Rate Increase was DevelopedUsing the experience and the proposed assumptions the medical loss ratio for the group will be 90.2 percent. To achieve the target loss ratio of 80.5 percent Rocky Mountain need a rate increase of 12.02 percent.h) Consumer CommentsThe Division received consumer comments on this filing and considered these comments in its review of the filing, to the extent appropriate. The Division may have had access to confidential information that the consumer did not.

The Cost and Utilization trends for medical were nearly 7 percent and for pharmacy they were over 17 percent.Changes in benefits:Plans that did not contain pediatric dental benefits were discontinued.  All plans offered in 2015 are fully ACA-compliant.  There was no impact to the premium due to this change.Administrative costs and anticipated profits:The administrative cost target is 14.2 percent with an anticipated profit target of 3 percent.",Review Complete,12.02,80208CO014,SG Bronze,Rocky Mountain Health Care Options,COLORADO,CO,Quarterly,12.02,12.02,RC

Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase.  We expect medical costs to go up 9.7% excluding the effect of benefit changes described below.  Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in Florida, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&bull;	Expenses for emergency treatment have increased 20%.&bull;	The use of outpatient hospital services has increased 17.5%.&bull;	Outpatient mental health visits have gone up 12%.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer Florida small businesses a variety of plans to choose from.  We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements.  On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes increased expected medical costs by an average of 1.9%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates.  These include:&bull;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&bull;	Enhanced network access standards&ndash; which limit our ability to control the cost and quality of medical care&bull;	Changes to required taxes and feesWill Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 9.63%?No, the 9.63% is an average.  Some premiums will increase by less or even go down.  Others will increase by more than the average.  The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling employees, where in Florida the group is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.&emsp;How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business.  Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care.  These actions include:&bull;	Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull;	Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Aetna Navigator, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services. Additionally, Aetna&rsquo;s Plan for Your Health website aims to educate all consumers, not just Aetna members, on how to take advantage of their health care benefits.",Review Complete,10.47,23841FL009,Aetna Preferred Provider Organization,Aetna Life Insurance Company,FLORIDA,FL,Annual,10.47,10.47,RC

At the time of filing, Humana requested a 25.5% rate increase, to be effective January 1, 2015.  The requested increase applied to Humana&rsquo;s individual HMO products, to be marketed on and off exchange.  Humana stated that the requested increase applied to new and existing business on Policy Form Series AZ-71129.  On June 24, 2014, Humana made changes to the filing that decreased the overall rate increase impact to 23.5% (Minimum: 15.4 %, Maximum:  33.5 %, Weighted Average:  23.5 %).AZDOI requested that its consulting threshold rate review actuaries, Gabriel, Roeder Smith&amp; Company (&ldquo;GRS&rdquo;), perform actuarial analysis of the filing and requested increase.  GRS found Humana&rsquo;s requested increase of 23.5% to be reasonable in relation to the benefits provided under the provisions of Arizona&rsquo;s threshold rate increase rule, AAC R20-6-2301 through R20-6-2305, and the federal rules related to threshold rate review in 45 CFR Part 154.  This determination was based on GRS&rsquo;s analysis of the rate development, including the medical cost trend and utilization, changes to the amount of funding available from the transitional reinsurance program, anticipated changed in the average morbidity, plan design changes, and changes to taxes and fees, as well as other considerations.Additionally, AAC R20-6-2301(B)(15) lists five factors that are relevant to finding an increase unreasonable.  None of the five factors applied to this filing.Thus, AZDOI determined that Humana&rsquo;s January 1, 2015 individual HMO rate increase of 23.5% is reasonable under AAC R20-6-2301 through R20-6-2305 and 45 CFR Part 154.

Additionally, simple services can be replaced with more complex services over time, which is known as mix intensity trend.

Under Maryland law, rates may not be inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.  Each rate filing is reviewed on its own merits.  The Commissioner&rsquo;s rate decisions must be based on statistical analysis and reasonable assumptions.  To assist the Commissioner in making these decisions, Maryland Insurance Administration (&ldquo;MIA&rdquo;) actuaries examine the data, methods and assumptions used by each insurer, non-profit health service plan, or HMO (&ldquo;carrier&rdquo;).  They review numerous factors related to proposed premium rates, including the carrier&rsquo;s actual and projected claims experience, medical and prescription costs, administrative costs, and profits or losses.  The Commissioner also considers the impact premium rates will have on Maryland consumers.  Under the federal Affordable Care Act and Maryland law, in the individual and small group markets, 80 cents of every premium dollar must be spent on paying claims or on quality improvement activities that figure increases to 85 cents in the large group market.  If an insurance carrier does not meet these targets, the carrier must pay rebates to policyholders.Modifications to Requested Premium Rates and Basis of ModificationsGroup Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc. submitted a rate filing on May 1, 2014, requesting an average rate increase of 38.1%.  On May 23, 2014, the Company amended its filing to request an average rate increase of 30.2%.  The amended rate filing reflected certain minor adjustments in response to MIA objections, such as modifying its assumptions about projected average age and the projected cost and utilization of dental benefits.  The most significant change, however, was a reduction in the Company&rsquo;s projections about the morbidity of its 2015 individual market enrollees as compared with the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  Specifically, in its amended filing, the Company assigned to its projected 2015 individual market enrollees a morbidity factor that was 1.60 times the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  In its May 1, 2014 filing, the Company had assumed a morbidity factor of 1.75.  The MIA proceeded to review the amended May 23, 2014 filing.The MIA concluded that certain of the Company&rsquo;s data, methods, and assumptions were not well supported, including certain assumptions about the projected morbidity of its individual product enrollees in 2015.  In particular, the Company had not adequately supported its assumptions regarding the number of small group enrollees projected to migrate to its individual products, or its assumptions about the morbidity levels of previously uninsured enrollees.  The MIA further concluded that the Company&rsquo;s actual experience during the first half of 2014, as well as other considerations relating to actual and projected enrollment in the 2014 and 2015 individual market, did not support a 1.60 morbidity factor.  The Commissioner also concluded that the requested average premium rate increase of 30.2% would have an abrupt, substantial, and adverse impact on the approximately 12,714 Marylanders currently enrolled in Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s Affordable Care Act-compliant plans in the individual market, and would introduce a high level of volatility into Maryland&rsquo;s individual health insurance market.The MIA prescribed a morbidity factor of 1.40, rather than the Company&rsquo;s requested morbidity factor of 1.60.  This modification resulted in an approximately 10.6% reduction in the Company&rsquo;s proposed premium rates for 2015.As modified during the rate review process, Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s premium rates for 2015 reflect an approximately 16.2% increase as compared with its premium rates for 2014.&emsp;DeterminationPursuant to&sect; 11-603(c)(2) of the Insurance Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, the Commissioner has determined that the Company&rsquo;s premium rates,  as modified during the rate review process, are not inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.Rate Review Standards and ConsiderationsThe Insurance Commissioner approves health insurance rates in Maryland.

The rates set forth in this filing were calculated as directed in the MIA Order, and CareFirst believes that they are inadequate.Accordingly, while the rates in this submission are filed as directed by the MIA Order and based upon the prescribed morbidity factor of 1.40, the information contained in this Actuarial Memorandum reflects a morbidity factor of 1.60.1.	SCOPE AND RANGE OF THE RATE INCREASE: CF is proposing to raise annual premiums by 16.2%, prior to age band changes. (For CFI the proposed renewal is 11.9%.) The range is 13.6% to 20.1%. (For renewing customers, an age band change adds 2.6% to the renewal, on average, with a range of 0.0% to 4.7% for ages 22 and upwards per the CMS age curve.)The primary factors driving this proposed change in premium rates area)	Projected significant increase in membership volumes with average morbidities higher than 2014.b)	Migration in the pool of former enrollees in Maryland&rsquo;s high risk pool the Maryland Health Insurance Plan (MHIP).c)	An aging of the pool of members.d)	An increase in the cost of medical care delivery in the form of claims trend driven by increases in both unit cost and utilization.e)	An increase in the health insurer fee.2.	FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE OF THE PRODUCT: The incurred period is 1-1-13 through 12-31-13. Total premiums and allowed claims for the period were $27,514,930 and $32,329,729, respectively.A.	Changes in the Morbidity of the Population Insured: CareFirst calculated its proposed rates based upon a morbidity factor of 1.60 however, the rates in this filing are calculated based upon a morbidity factor of 1.40 as ordered by the MIA Order.  CareFirst estimates a morbidity risk factor of 1.60 for 2015 as relayed through the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filings (SERFF) on 5-23-14. Our 1.60 factor was computed after consideration for the morbidity risk factor that was included in the 2014 filed and approved rates.  The morbidity risk factor projections are based upon the model that supported CareFirst&rsquo;s 2014 rate filings.  The model compares known and estimated allowed claims costs per member per month (pmpm) for 2013 to project the cost of various categories of the estimated 2015 membership.  These categories are based upon the prior status of the 2015 membership&ndash; previous CareFirst members (medically underwritten under 65 Individuals, MHIP, Group) and New Entrants sorted by income (less than 200% FPL, greater than 200% FPL).  The risk factor for each category is expressed in terms of allowed claims pmpm cost, and is calculated by comparing the category pmpm claims cost to the 2013 CareFirst Individual membership pmpm cost.  More than 50% of the projected 2015 membership is included in categories supported by actual claims data supporting the previous CareFirst member categories.  The New Entrants&rsquo; categories use projected risk scores based upon a Hilltop study (Basic Health Plan) for the members less than 200% FPL and the Group factor for the greater than 200% FPL members. The Group factor is based upon the almost 250 thousand CareFirst Small Group members that have for decades been community rated and guaranteed issue as is now required under ACA for Individual enrollees. CareFirst&rsquo;s judgment is that this extremely large community rated, guaranteed issue small group pool of members is most representative of the New Entrants greater than 200% FPL.B.	Changes in Demographics: Comparing the overall CareFirst member-level average age as of        12-31-12 to 3-31-14, the average age has increased by 4.5 years from 34.0 to 38.5. Age factors will account for a portion of the corresponding increase in claims cost. We find the CMS age curve spread of 3 to 1 to be lower than the 4.5 to 1 that is more correlated with expected claims costs. We have therefore adjusted expected claims costs accordingly in the experience period (EP) index rate projection in the other category.C.	Trend Factors (Cost-Utilization): The proposed trend of 6.5% is a reduction of 270 basis points from 2014&rsquo;s 9.2%. The improvement is concentrated in outpatient hospital and prescription drug services which comprise 37% of total allowed claims.D.	Projected Loss Ratio: Our projected NAIC DICR for MLR purposes is 83.5%, above the 80.0% minimum of Public Health Service Act (PHSA) 218.3.	CHANGES IN MEDICAL SERVICE COSTS: The experience period index rate is a key component driving the renewal. Last year&rsquo;s implicit 2013 index rate was $222 ($203 x trend of 9.2%). The actual for 2013 is $213 for a favorable variance of -4%.4.	CHANGES IN BENEFITS: For CareFirst&rsquo;s Individual offerings in Maryland, our portfolio is not changing. We will still offer 15 benefit plans&ndash; 1 Young Adult-Catastrophic, 4 Bronze, 4 Silver, 4 Gold and 2 Platinum. We have recalculated the costs of&ldquo;Essential Health Benefits&rdquo; (EHB) as well as Non-EHBs.a)	Per COMAR 31.10.39 Utilization Review of Treatment for Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders, Bulletin 14-07 and due to the passage of SB 759-HB 783, Coverage for Autism Spectrum Disorders, we have calculated an increase in claims of $3 per member per month (PMPM) for 2015. This is largely for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) treatments and is a state-mandated EHB benefit. The $3 PMPM is derived from an incidence assumption of 1 in 68 children ages 1-19, an uptake rate of 1 in 3 and an intensity rate of $40,000 to $95,000 per year depending on age.b)	Other adjustments were made for pediatric dental, mandatory generics, a new hepatitis C prescription drug, Sovaldi, and maternity.c)	Other Adjustments: CareFirst (CF) is proposing to introduce an incentive program (IP) whereby members can earn medical expense debit cards of as much as $250 annually, for an individual ($650 for a family). The cards must be utilized for qualified medical expenses such as deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket costs. The scope includes all benefit plans within CF&rsquo;s portfolio, On and Off the Exchange. This is being done in a revenue-neutral way. That is, the cost to CF of the incentive payments was chosen such that they match the expected savings to CF from more efficacious health care delivery. HealthyBlue (HB) was first launched effective 10-1-10 with the objective of motivating and rewarding greater engagement by the member in his or her health, improved wellness and prevention and better provider coordination and quality. As we sought to respond to feedback about HB, subsequent versions were released on 1-1-12 and 10-1-12. This IP represents an evolution of the HB concept. Further, it joins the tenets of HB with our Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) program which was launched on January, 2011.Our aim is that this IP will improve our members&rsquo; health.d)	Included are decreases to claims costs for a change in our Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) in 2014.e)	Membership Projections: We had projected 58% of enrollment in HMO-based plans as of 12-31-14 in our 2014 filings. Actual data as of 4-10-14 indicates that HMO comprises 69% of our CFI members. We had also expected 5% of enrollment in Platinum plans versus actuals of 13%. We incorporated both of these facts in projecting 12-31-15 enrollment.f)	    For the Young Adult-Catastrophic plan, the deductible-out-of-pocket maximum has been raised from $6,350 to $6,600 per year.g)	Also, per HB 0625, oral chemotherapy coverage has been mandated. The cost of reducing cost shares to not exceed those of intravenous chemotherapy has been deemed negligible.h)	Diabetic supplies have been moved to $0 copays. The deductible applies for H.S.A. plans but not for non-H.S.A.s with negligible price impact.i)	    Retail Clinics such as urgent care centers will have reduced copays to match the PCP rather than specialist copay with negligible price impact.j)	    A 5-tiered structure (Generics-Preferred, Generics-Non-Preferred, Brand Name-Preferred, Brand Name-Non-Preferred, Specialty) is currently used for approximately 20% of our benefits. This is changing to 4-tier structure by collapsing the Generics tiers.5.	ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED CONTRIBUTION TO RESERVE: The 2015 desired incurred claims ratio (DICR) is 79.3%.A.	Administrative Expense Load: PMPMs increased by 3% versus 2014.B.	CtR&amp; Risk Margin: Remains at 0.0%, break-even.C.	Taxes and Fees:I.	Community Health Investment of 2.0%.II.

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 13.13%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 104 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 9.8% year over year excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in North Carolina, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&#61623; The cost for an outpatient hospital service has increased 10%.&#61623; The cost for an inpatient hospital admission has increased 5.4%.&#61623; Costs for pharmacy prescriptions are increasing 7% year over year due to the release of Sovaldi for Hepatitis-C patients.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer North Carolina small businesses a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements, as well as to comply with the metal value requirements for small group plan designs. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes increased expected medical costs by an average of 2.5%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&#61623;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing (also known as the Federal Transitional Policy)&#61623; Enhanced network access standards&ndash; which limit our ability to control the cost and quality of medical care&#61623; Changes to required taxes and feesWill Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 13.13%?No, the stated increases are averages. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down. Others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling employees, where in North Carolina the group is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that groups pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Aetna Navigator, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services.

HIC anticipates that 61% of its policies will be sold On Exchange.In support of their request, HIC has provided premium rates, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template, a Part II Written Explanation of The Rate Increase, and a Part III Actuarial Memorandum. The actuarial memorandum included, inter alia, actuarial assumptions, anticipated loss ratios, other information required by the ACA and appropriate actuarial certifications.INS has reviewed the submission in its entirety. However, INS has given special consideration in its review to the details of the Company&rsquo;s Part III Actuarial Memorandum, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template and the characteristics of the rating elements subject to the Federal regulations prescribed in 45CFR Part 147 paragraph 147.102.  Based on that review, INS has come to the following key conclusions:URRT Section 1 Experience Period Data&bull;	Earned premiums, incurred claims, allowed claims and index rate per member per month (PMPM) for the experience period, January 2013 through December 2013, appear lower than average&bull;	The completion method used to determine estimated incurred claims and allowed claims is consistent with accepted actuarial methods&bull;	HIC anticipates paying $938,596 in MRL rebates, based on its 2013 experience&bull;	Member months for the Experience Period, 148,154, is expected to decrease slightly to 126,174 for the Projection Period.URRT Section II Allowed Claims, PMPM Basis&bull;	Benefit Category descriptions closely follow the preferred descriptions of the URRT instructions&bull;	The utilization per 1,000 and the average cost/service factors by benefit category for the Experience Period appear to be  lower than average for the Individual market&bull;	The total allowed PMPM claim cost of $180.14 (Section II) matches the index rate of $180.00 (Section I) for the experience period (difference due to rounding)&bull;	The overall annual Trend assumption of 6.5%, projected for two years, appears to be reasonable.&bull;	HIC used a&lsquo;Population Risk Morbidity&rsquo; factor of 1.84 to project their underlying experience. The expected increase in morbidity is due to:1.	The inability to underwrite new entrants2.	Adverse Selection3.	Changes in the expected plan mixBased on the narrative and chart provided by the company, INS believes the 1.84 Morbidity factor to be reasonable&bull;	The&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factor used by HIC to project their underlying experience was set to 1.101. The main drivers behind this factor were:1.	Induced utilization2.	Additional benefits to meet the Essential Health Benefit (EHB) guidelines3.	Demographic changes4.	Changes in the geographic distribution of the membershipBased on the narrative and chart provided by the company, INS believes the 1.101&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factor to be reasonable.URRT Section II Credibility Manual&bull;	The basis of HIC&rsquo;s Credibility Manual is the company&rsquo;s own nationwide Individual health experience for 2013&bull;	The trend assumption used for the Credibility Manual, 6.5%, was the same assumption used for projecting the experience data&bull;	The&lsquo;Population Risk Morbidity&rsquo; and&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factors used for the Credibility Manual were fine-tuned slightly from those used to project the experience data in order to  adjust for using nationwide data&bull;	 Based on the narrative provided by the company, the development of the Credibility Manual appears reasonable.URRT Section III Projected Experience&bull;	HIC&rsquo;s&lsquo;Projected Allowed Experience Claims PMPM&rsquo; is based 64.5% on its projected actual experience and 35.5% on its Credibility Manual.  The method used to determine the credibility of the Experience Period data appears to be actuarially reasonable&bull;	The method used to determine the&lsquo;Paid to Allowed Average Factor in the Projection Period&rsquo; of 79.5% is actuarially acceptable and such average factor is consistent with the&lsquo;paid to allowed&rsquo; ratios at the plan level (before leveraging adjustment)&bull;	Companies are allowed to make a Risk Adjustment in developing its incurred claims on the URRT. Risk adjustment calculates a risk score for each plan participant, based upon age, sex and diagnosis. This is used to calculate the company&rsquo;s Plan average risk score. Because HIC anticipates its market level risk scores to be higher than the average risk score for Tennessee, it expects to receive a payment for having a higher risk population. Based on the narrative and spreadsheet provided by the company, INS believes the Risk Adjustment of $58.05 to be actuarially reasonable&bull;	The assumptions and methods used to determine the&lsquo;Projected ACA reinsurance recoveries, net of reinsurance premium, PMPM of $38.07 appear reasonable and consistent with accepted actuarial practice&bull;&lsquo;Administrative Expense Load&rsquo;,&lsquo;Profit&amp; Risk Load&rsquo; and&lsquo;Taxes&amp; Fees&rsquo; appear reasonable for the Individual market&bull;	The&lsquo;Index Rate for Projection Period&rsquo; of $420.40 matches the 2015&lsquo;Projected Allowed Experience Claims PMPM&rsquo;. This is expected for Individual plans that provide only EHBs.Part III Actuarial Memorandum&bull;	The Company&rsquo;s actuarial memorandum satisfies the Part III Actuarial Memorandum and Certification Instructions dated March 20, 2014 and issued by the Department of Health and Human Services&bull;	The company&rsquo;s calculation of the projected medical loss ratio (MLR) of 80.0% is actuarially reasonable&bull;	The company&rsquo;s methodology used to derive the Market Adjusted Index Rate, Plan Adjusted Index Rates, Consumer Adjusted Index Rates and Calibration Factors is consistent with accepted actuarial methods&bull;	The Company&rsquo;s analysis and calculation of Actuarial Values comply with guidance provided in the PPACA, HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2015, Final Rule, 79 FR 13743 (March11, 2014)&bull;	The Company did not have any&ldquo;warning alerts&rdquo; in Worksheet 2 of the URRT&bull;	The actuarial memorandum included the required actuarial certifications.Federal regulations prescribed in 45CFR Part 147 paragraph 147.102&bull;	All premium rates vary only with respect to allowable rating factors: [1] family composition, [2] age, [3] geographic area and [4] tobacco usage&bull;	Relating to the family rating and in accordance with the subject Federal regulation, the premium calculation follows a member-level build up approach which is capped such that no more than the three oldest covered children under the age 21 can be taken into account when determining the total family premium&bull;	Relating to the premium age curve and in accordance with the subject Federal regulation, the premium variation between the youngest and the oldest adult individuals between the ages of 21-64 does not exceed a ratio of 3:1 (and adheres to the Health and Human Services&rsquo; Default Standard Age Curve)&bull;	Relating to tobacco usage, tobacco rates are 10% higher than non-tobacco rates.

(NAIC code number 55107) has applied to the Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services to adjust premium rates for its community-rated small group and individual qualified health plans.I. OVERVIEWThe rates being sought contain a zero percent operating margin for the health plan despite the health plan reporting operating losses in 2013 and a forecasted significant operating loss in 2014. The proposed rate adjustment is based on the need to adjust prospectively from the state&rsquo;s reduction of rates by 6.3% on small group qualified health plans and by 4.0% on individual qualified health plans for 2014, an increasing medical cost trend, and changes in the health insurance market driven by federal and state actions. Other contributing factors for the proposed 2015 rate adjustment include increases in fees, taxes and added coverage for new mandated benefits.Excellus Health Plan and related companies (EHP) provide health insurance and administrative services for about 1.8 million upstate New Yorkers in 39 counties. The proposed premium rates affect about 182,000 members or 10% of the health plan&rsquo;s total membership. Its proposed rates are subject to review by the New York Department of Financial Services pursuant to section 4308c of the New York Insurance Law. The Department may approve the proposed rate increase as requested, modify the proposed rate increase, or disapprove the proposed rate increase in its entirety. The determination by the Department shall be supported by sound actuarial assumptions and methods.The rate application will be filed with the Department on or about June 13, 2014. The actual rate increases approved by the Department will be communicated to the impacted parties at least 60 days prior to the date the new rate is implemented for the subscriber. EHP policyholders with renewal dates during 2015 would, if approved, receive the indicated rate adjustments on their next anniversary date on or after January 1, 2015.Excellus Health Plan is required by New York State law to develop rates that assume that at least 82% of premium revenue will be spent on health care costs in the direct pay market along with small groups, be actuarially sound, cover all claim costs, and provide a contribution to ensure adequate reserves. The percent of premium attributable to claims is referred to as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).Excellus Health Plan's MLR has been and continues to exceed the statutory minimums. In 2013, the MLR for Excellus Health Plan was 94.2% for individual direct pay and 91.0% for small groups. Under new reporting requirements for 2014, the three-year cumulative MLR is 94.4% for individual direct pay and 91.5% for small group qualified health plans. With the proposed rate adjustments, Excellus Health Plan's MLRs would remain well above the minimum levels. In the event the MLR falls below the required minimum, the health plan refunds any difference to policyholders.Periodic rate adjustments are necessary to secure the ability of Excellus Health Plan, or any insurer, to produce sufficient revenue and surplus for reserves to assure continued coverage and claim payments both for current health care needs, and potential catastrophic cost situations. Excellus Health Plan's reserves vary from year to year based on actual health care costs incurred. As of Dec. 31, 2013, the health plan had reserves equivalent to 2.5 months of claims and operating expense, and more than the minimum required by New York State law. These reserves are the insurance that assures payment even when costs run higher than anticipated, or emergencies or disasters occur, and should not be used as an alternative fund to temporarily reduce rate adjustments.In filing its rate application, Excellus Health Plan is sensitive to the fact that individuals and small businesses struggle to afford higher premiums. However, it is clear that an increase in premiums is necessary to assure the continued operations of the Plan and the viability of its product offerings. Because EHP already has a high MLR, failure to approve these rates would only lead to the need for even greater rate increases in the future as claim costs would eventually exceed premiums collected.II. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASEEscalating health care costsThe cost of health care services, equipment and products continues to be the primary reason for rate increases.Trend is a very important consideration in determining the need for a premium rate adjustment. Upstate New York is not immune to national trends in health care costs given our state&rsquo;s population and demographics. Industry experts such as Segal Consulting and Buck Consultants are forecasting a 7.2-10.4% medical benefit trend nationwide for 2014. EHP is forecasting an overall medical benefit trend factor for its commercial fully insured business of 6.8% for 2014-2015. The trend forecast takes into account projected increases in costs attributed to what Excellus Health Plan pays out in claims expenses for hospital inpatient and outpatient care, professional services, pharmacy benefits and other goods and services. The health plan&rsquo;s anticipated changes in medical benefit spending are summarized as follows:Hospital inpatient, 6.9%Hospital outpatient, 6.4%Professional services, 4.5%Pharmacy, 10.6%Other medical goods and services, 7.5%These trends do not include adjustments to base rates for previous rate increases that were insufficient to cover claims and operating expenses for some plan options.Health care costs for each of those benefit components take into account the compounding effects of both the price of the goods or services provided as well as the quantity of the goods and services consumed.The impact that each trend has to the overall cost of coverage is related to proportionate size of the benefit component. For example, overall spending would rise faster as a result of a 5% increase in professional services versus a 5% increase in drug costs because professional services represents a larger share of medical benefit spending.III. NEW YORK TAXES AND ASSESSMENTSInsurance taxes are built into the costs of health coverage. New Yorkers who voluntarily purchase private health insurance coverage paid more than $4 billion in state health taxes in 2011, according to an analysis by the New York State Conference of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans.New York&rsquo;s Health Care Reform Act of 1996 (HCRA) created two surcharges on health insurance and an additional tax is imposed under Section 206 (formerly Section 332) of the state Insurance Law.The covered lives assessment is an annual flat surcharge or tax on every person who has insurance coverage in the state. Health plans are assessed on the basis of the number of people they cover with individual and family rates that vary depending on the residence of the insured. Among upstate regions defined by the state, the annual covered lives assessment rates in 2014 that impact Excellus Health Plan members are as follows:Per Certificate Per Year by region (Individual : Family)Western: $39.40: $130.03Rochester: $105.72: $348.87Central: $55.59: $183.46Utica-Watertown: $8.54: $28.17Northeastern: $39.94: $131.79The second surcharge created by the 1996 Health Care Reform Act is collected from health plans in the form of a sales tax on many hospital-related services. The surcharge is applied to both self-insured and fully insured plans. Beginning at 8.18% in 1997, the surcharge is now at 9.63%.The third levy, the Section 206 assessment, was originally established to finance New York State Department of Insurance operations but its funding purposes have expanded beyond that purpose. The assessments apply to all licensed insurers in the state (e.g. life, property and casualty, and health), and are based on New York premiums.In total, the above New York taxes and assessments including Section 206 aggregated to nearly 6% of the 2015 small group and individual qualified health plans&rsquo; premium.IV. FEDERAL TAXES, MANDATES AND ADJUSTMENTSAnnual fee on health insurance providers:Beginning in 2014, this fee is based on each health insurance company&rsquo;s market share of net premiums written, adjusted for size and corporate structure.The federal law requires the total fee on nationwide health insurance providers to be collected is:$8 billion in 2014,$11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016,$13.9 billion in 2017, and$14.3 billion in 2018.After 2018, the fee is expected to collect $14.3 billion, indexed to the rate of growth in premiums.Each year, the calculation will be based on the market share of each assessed plan and will change based on the number of companies in the insured market. Under this fee provision, a health plan could incur financial losses but would still be subject to the market share fee.For EHP, this fee increase represents a 1.2% increase to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans for 2015.Risk Adjustment Program:The risk adjustment program is a permanent provision that applies to both the individual and small group insurance market. This federal program assesses a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and uses the revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members.A fee of $0.96 per member per year is collected to fund the risk adjustment program. For EHP, this program reduces small group qualified health plans&rsquo; premiums by about 1.5%. For 2015, this program has no impact on the premium of individual direct pay qualified health plans.Transitional reinsurance program for the individual market:The federal law created a temporary reinsurance program that is to collect nationwide:$10 billion in 2014,$6 billion in 2015, and$4 billion in 2016.Additionally, a separate contribution is to be deposited into the U.S. Treasury that will total $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016.The contribution rate is to be based on a $44 national per capita yearly amount in 2015. All insurers and self- insured group health plans are required to contribute on behalf of all group health plans and health insurance coverage they provide. For EHP, this fee represents about 1% of premium but it is about 40% less than last year resulting in a 0.5% decrease to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans in 2015.For the individual qualified health plans, the federal government established reinsurance for excessive claims. The amount of money being distributed in 2014 is being reduced in 2015. At the same time, this reduction will require a 3.8% premium increase for individual qualified health plans.Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) fee:The federal law created the PCORI to help stakeholders make informed health decisions by advancing the quality and relevance of evidence-based medicine through the use of comparative clinical effectiveness research findings. The fee is set at $2 per year multiplied by the average number of lives covered under the plan for plan years ending before October 1, 2014. And, for plan years ending on or after October 1, 2014, the fee increases based on the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures.Federal mental health mandateThe federal requirements for coverage of mental health parity require a 0.2% increase to current premium to pay for required benefits in 2015.V. OPERATING EXPENSE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTSA portion of what is reported to the state as administrative expenses is attributed to what Federal Health Reform considers quality improvement expenses, meaning the federal government recognizes that these represent costs that lead to overall improvements in health care versus simply a routine business expense, and as a result will be considered a medical benefit expense for purposes of federal MLR calculations.Those quality improvement expenses include such items as:-Improvements in health outcomes brought about by case management and disease management programs,-Actions taken to help prevent hospital readmissions through such things as discharge planning and counseling,-Wellness and community health promotional activities, and-Health information technology that is used to help measure clinical effectiveness and predictive modeling.The proposed rates will more accurately reflect the true operating expense of administering the federal Health Care Reform legislation through the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange. The changes in the health insurance market required building and implementing an entirely new sales channel from what had primarily been a business-to-business marketplace.This required:-The implementation of a new sales call center that saw extended open enrollment deadlines in 2014,-The hiring of additional staff,-Increased direct-to-consumer communication costs to educate consumers about new products and how to access those products, and-The building and implementation of new products, new infrastructure for the continued improvements and changes to the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange and for the implementation of additional mandates for the federal Health Care Reform.Operating expenses - including quality improvement initiatives but excluding federal and state taxes, fees and assessments, and broker commissions - represent 8.7% of premium in small group qualified health plans and 8.4% in individual qualified health plans.VI. REGULATION 146Regulation 146 was a market stabilization mechanism for the individual and small group pools that was in effect prior to the adoption of the ACA. Similar to the ACA Risk Adjustment program, Reg. 146 attempted to equalize the risk within the small group and individual markets by assessing a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and used this revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members. Because of the redundancy with the new risk adjustment program, Reg. 146 is being phased out. The Department of Financial Services is requiring plans to distribute all outstanding compensations through premium adjustments in 2015 and 2016. This distribution plan results in a reduction in the small group qualified health plan premium of 0.3% and in individual premium of about 1%.",Review Complete,9.23,78124NY088,ExcellusBCBS EPO Copay,"Excellus Health Plan, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Annual,18.78,18.78,RC

(NAIC code number 55107) has applied to the Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services to adjust premium rates for its community-rated small group and individual qualified health plans.I. OVERVIEWThe rates being sought contain a zero percent operating margin for the health plan despite the health plan reporting operating losses in 2013 and a forecasted significant operating loss in 2014. The proposed rate adjustment is based on the need to adjust prospectively from the state&rsquo;s reduction of rates by 6.3% on small group qualified health plans and by 4.0% on individual qualified health plans for 2014, an increasing medical cost trend, and changes in the health insurance market driven by federal and state actions. Other contributing factors for the proposed 2015 rate adjustment include increases in fees, taxes and added coverage for new mandated benefits.Excellus Health Plan and related companies (EHP) provide health insurance and administrative services for about 1.8 million upstate New Yorkers in 39 counties. The proposed premium rates affect about 182,000 members or 10% of the health plan&rsquo;s total membership. Its proposed rates are subject to review by the New York Department of Financial Services pursuant to section 4308c of the New York Insurance Law. The Department may approve the proposed rate increase as requested, modify the proposed rate increase, or disapprove the proposed rate increase in its entirety. The determination by the Department shall be supported by sound actuarial assumptions and methods.The rate application will be filed with the Department on or about June 13, 2014. The actual rate increases approved by the Department will be communicated to the impacted parties at least 60 days prior to the date the new rate is implemented for the subscriber. EHP policyholders with renewal dates during 2015 would, if approved, receive the indicated rate adjustments on their next anniversary date on or after January 1, 2015.Excellus Health Plan is required by New York State law to develop rates that assume that at least 82% of premium revenue will be spent on health care costs in the direct pay market along with small groups, be actuarially sound, cover all claim costs, and provide a contribution to ensure adequate reserves. The percent of premium attributable to claims is referred to as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).Excellus Health Plan's MLR has been and continues to exceed the statutory minimums. In 2013, the MLR for Excellus Health Plan was 94.2% for individual direct pay and 91.0% for small groups. Under new reporting requirements for 2014, the three-year cumulative MLR is 94.4% for individual direct pay and 91.5% for small group qualified health plans. With the proposed rate adjustments, Excellus Health Plan's MLRs would remain well above the minimum levels. In the event the MLR falls below the required minimum, the health plan refunds any difference to policyholders.Periodic rate adjustments are necessary to secure the ability of Excellus Health Plan, or any insurer, to produce sufficient revenue and surplus for reserves to assure continued coverage and claim payments both for current health care needs, and potential catastrophic cost situations.

We expect medical costs to go up 7.8%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below.  Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in Nevada with an HMO product, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&bull;	The cost for an inpatient hospital admission has increased 18.8%.&bull;	Costs for pharmacy prescriptions have gone up 15.6%.&bull;	Expenses for mental health treatment have increased 23.9%.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase Premiums?The proposed change includes the impact of continuing to use our existing HMO network for these plans instead of a new, more limited network as previously expected.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Employer business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care.  These actions include:&bull;	Developing new agreements, arrangements, and  partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull;	Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Aetna Navigator, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services.

They used their 2013 small group PPO experience as the basis for the 2015 premium rates. Premium rate increases range by product from about 3% to 20%. The key drivers of the rate increases are medical trend, adjustment for hepatitis C drugs, and benefit changes. The projected medical trend for the block is about 9.2%. Aetna provided a nationwide utilization study that demonstrated the utilization trends utilized in the rate development. Additionally, the unit cost projection factors were based on an internal model that evaluates the impact of provider contract changes.

Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase.  We expect medical costs to go up 9%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below.  Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in Illinois, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&bull;	Cost per pharmacy prescription has gone up 16.8%&bull;	Cost for emergency room visits have increased 19.2%&bull;	The cost of home healthcare has gone up 38.6%What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsSeveral requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates.

Some premiums will increase by less or even go down.  Others will increase by more than the average.  The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling employees, and where in Illinois the group is located.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care.  These actions include:&bull;	Developing new agreements, arrangements, and  partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull;	Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have.

The projected 2015 plan year medical loss ratio after the proposed rate increases is 87.0 percent.The choice of assumptions and the combination of assumptions upon which the rate increase is based are reasonable.  When HHS applied these assumptions, the rate increase was not found to be excessive.",Not Applicable,"Scope and Range of the Rate Increase:Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas (BCBSTX) proposes to raise premium rates by an average of 11.7% for the Blue Choice product effective January 1, 2015, included in the filing applicable to QHP ACA compliant plans. The proposed average premium rate increase is 11.2% across all products included in the filing.As of May 31, 2014, there were 141,459 members on the Blue Choice product who could be impacted by the rate increase.The filed annual increases vary from 9.8% to 23.6% on the Blue Choice product based on various characteristics such as differences in the expected change in cost sharing between plans. Changes in the member's demographics, such as aging or moving to a different geographical region, may also affect the increase each member receives.Changes in Medical Service Costs:The proposed rates for the Blue Choice products include 6.7% for expected increasing medical costs and 11.0% effective for expected increasing prescription drug costs.The 6.7% for medical costs includes roughly 4.0% due to higher expected reimbursement rates to providers, 1.6% due to higher expected utilization, and 1.0% due to the expectation that member cost will increase less than medical costs, sometimes referred to as benefit leveraging.The 11.0% for prescription drug costs includes roughly 7.1% due to higher expected reimbursement costs, 1.6% due to higher expected utilization, and 2.0% due to benefit leveraging.Administrative Costs and Anticipated Profits:The proposed increase had negligible impact resulting from changes in administrative costs.The proposed increase does not reflect any changes to assumptions related to the anticipated underwriting gain or loss across the single risk pool. The proposed rate increase is expected to result in a 5.0% gain (pre-tax as a percent of premium) on the BCBSTX block of small group business.Other:Policyholders who benefit financially from the extended transitional policy are more likely to maintain their coverage, and policyholders who benefit financially from purchasing an Affordable Care Act policy are more likely to switch coverage to anAffordable Care Act policy. The proposed rates include a 2.6% increase to offset the expected impact of this policyholder selection.Financial Experience of the Product:These policies began selling January 1, 2014. There is limited financial experience to report at this time.The proposed rates are expected to result in a medical loss ratio greater than 80%.",Review Complete,11.73,33602TX043,Blue Choice PPO,Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas,TEXAS,TX,Annual,11.73,11.73,RC

The company met Wisconsin&rsquo;s filing requirements for rate changes on ACA-compliant policies.

However, early indications show members signing up for ACA are significantly older and more risky than previously projected.  This difference in risk profile from previous projections is partially due to the transitional policy for non-ACA compliant plans, and is a market wide occurrence, not company specific.CHANGES IN MEDICAL SERVICE COSTSThe projection of claims from the experience period to the effective period assumes a 7 percent annual trend.  This claim assumption is based on analysis of the health plan&rsquo;s recent and expected experience.  This overall trend covers projected changes in utilization, unit costs and mix and intensity of services, for medical and pharmacy claims combined.CHANGES IN BENEFITSThere were no changes in benefits from 2014 to 2015, so no impact to the rate increase.ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED PROFITSDHP targets a loss ratio of 92 percent for its individual block of business.  This loss ratio allows 8 percent for total health plan administrative costs and anticipated profits.

We expect medical costs to go up 9.8% year over year excluding the effect of benefit changes described below.  Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in South Carolina, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&bull;	The cost for an inpatient hospital admission has increased 30%.&bull;	Costs for pharmacy prescriptions are increasing 9%  year over year due to the release of Sovaldi for Hepatitis-C patients.&bull;	Outpatient visits increased 14%.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer South Carolina small businesses a variety of plans to choose from.  We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements, as well as to comply with the metal value requirements for small group plan designs.  On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes increased expected medical costs by an average of 1.7%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates.  These include:&bull;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing (also known as the Federal Transitional Policy)&bull;	Enhanced network access standards&ndash; which limit our ability to control the cost and quality of medical care&bull;	Changes to required taxes and feesWill Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 10.3%?No, the 10.3% is an average.  Some premiums will increase by less or even go down.  Others will increase by more than the average.  The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling employees, where in South Carolina the group is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that groups pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care.  These actions include:&bull;	Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull;	Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have.

Also, applicable are Regulation 120-2-98, OCGA 33-30-26 and Regulation 120-2-44-.06 which requires that PPO renewal rates be certified by an actuary to not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory and must be&ldquo;filed&rdquo; with the department 30 days prior to use. Actuarial certification was provided along with supporting documentation including prior and project loss experience. Data provided indicated loss experience for the previous rating period produced a traditionally calculated loss ratio of 80% which equates approximately to a federal Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) of 86%. The target MLR per HHS is 80%. Projected loss ratio based on the requested rate increase and a 23% increase in incurred claims is 80% or an indicated federal MLR of 86%. Accordingly, past and projected loss ratios with the rate increase are compliant with federal loss ratio standards. Based on historical and projected loss ratios which are compliant with federal MLR targets and rate factors for trend, ACA taxes and fees, administration and profit are within established ranges, the Georgia Department filed this increase on 9-5-2014.",Not Applicable,"Aetna Life Insurance CompanyGeorgia Small Group PPO83978&ndash; Product 83978GA011SummaryAetna is filing rates for Small Group plans in Georgia. This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 13.1%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 6,883 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.For Product 83978GA011 the current enrollment is 6,883. These members will have an approximate rate increase of 13.1%.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 10.5%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer individuals in Georgia a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes decreased expected medical costs by an average of 0.3%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&#61623;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&#61623; Changes to required taxes and fees&#61623; Changes to Benefit Requirements&#61623; Restrictions on Underwriting practicesWill Premiums for All Small Group Plans Increase 13.1%?No, the 13.1% is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down, others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, the number of members (for family plans) and their ages, where in Georgia the employer is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of actions to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.",Review Complete,11.19,83978GA014,Aetna Preferred Provider Organization - PPO,Aetna Life Insurance Company,GEORGIA,GA,Annual,11.19,11.19,RC

For 2015, we have filed a single geographicor area factor of 15% that will apply to all small employer groups uniformly.This change in the application of the area factor causes our reported rate increase to fall in the range of 18.9% to 26.0%.Because we are reducing our average area adjustment from 22% to 15%, the actual rate change that will be experienced by the Utahsmall employer groups is approximately 0% since the 7% base rate increase is offset by the 7% reduction in the average area factor.Individual groups may see an increase or decrease in rates depending on the level of area factor that was included in their rates for 2014.The base rate increase of 7% is intended to cover increases in underlyng health costs covered by the small employer plans.The area factor adjustment covers the expected differences in cost for the employees covered by the Sterling product who resideoutside the state of Utah as compared with those that reside in the state.This rate change will apply to approximately 408 in-force small employer members.",Review Complete,23.08,51764UT001,Utah Small Employer Nation Care,Sterling Life Insurance Co.,UTAH,UT,Annual,23.08,23.08,RC

This filing proposes to reduce premium rates from our prior filing. The resulting annual increase is 10.1%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from April 2015 through December 2015.

We expect medical costs to go up 11.2%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in New Jersey, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&bull; Expenses for emergency treatment have increased 10%.&bull; Primary care physician office visits have increased 10%.&bull; Costs for pharmacy prescriptions have gone up 11%.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsThe rates in this filing reflect the impacts of a number of ACA-related requirements, including changes to taxes and fees and changes to benefit requirements.Will Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 10.1%?No, the 10.1% is an average. Rate changes differ by product due to the impact of benefit changes. These average increases are:&bull; 10.1% for HMO plans&bull; 9.9% for POS plansThe exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, and the age and family size for enrolling employees.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business.

The projected 2015 plan year medical loss ratio after the proposed rate increases is 80.0 percent, but the support provided was not adequate or substantial enough to fully support this percentage.","Assurant Health and its underwriting entity, Time Insurance Company, are committed to providing affordable health care coverage to meet the unique needs of individuals and families. We have a deep understanding of the affordability crisis within the healthcare marketplace and understand the challenge individuals and families have in paying premiums for their coverage. We understand that as a medical insurer we have a role in controlling costs. During the last several years we have reduced our administration and commission expenses significantly. Fundamentally, the vast majority of our rate increases reflect the cost of medical care that we fund on behalf of our policyholders. The following response helps to inform customers and other stakeholders about the company&rsquo;s position.1) How Assurant Health sets rates:Assurant Health is committed to setting premium rates at a level that allows us to continue to serve the needs of our customers. Our premium rates are based on appropriate actuarial practices, backed by decades of experience and expertise in the individual market.  In addition, we worked with independent actuarial consultants to validate our pricing methodology.  We maintain our recent rate filings are actuarially justified and appropriate, and that they will enable Assurant Health to meet the medical loss ratio (MLR) requirements under health care reform.2) Assumption support:We provided substantial support for the assumptions on which the 2015 rate increase is based.Plans effective on or after January 1, 2014 are guaranteed issue, which means all applicants must be issued coverage regardless of health status, this continues to impact the morbidity of the single risk pool in 2015.  We provided detailed support, including consultant data, outlining the development of our morbidity assumption, which adjusts for the impact of the guaranteed issue environment.Our medical trend assumption is supported by historical data and is based on the historical average claims trend of our customers. Assurant Health uses medical trend data that factors in both the rising cost of health care and the utilization of medical services and prescription drugs by our customers in determining premium rates.","This is a Time Insurance Company rate filing for our existing individual medical products.These are non-grandfathered Individual Major Medical products which cover the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) as required under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

The rate increase will be effective January 1, 2015.The rate increase was developed based on the pricing methodology prescribed by the ACA.This rate increase is needed because allowed medical trend is assumed to continue at an annual rate of 9.5%.  This includes increases in both the price and utilization of medical services.  In addition, there are new fees associated with the ACA which contributed to the rate increase. The increase is also caused by a decrease in reinsurance recoveries provided by the ACA reinsurance program.The loss ratio is the ratio of incurred claims to earned premium.  In Alabama, the target loss ratio is 73.5%, which equates to the 80% Medical Loss Ratio under the ACA after allowable adjustments.The main drivers of our administrative expenses are employee salaries and benefits, agent commissions, and premium taxes, licenses and fees.

Increases in the price of services are driven by technology advances, costshifting to private insurers from underfunded Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement and a variety ofother factors. Changes in utilization of services can be driven by the aging of the population, benefitdesign and many other factors. Within the projected medical trends, Anthem anticipates the majority ofthe cost increases are associated with higher prices for services and trend for prescription drugs.Administrative Costs and ProfitsAnthem continues to effectively manage and reduce administrative and selling costs from prior years.Administrative costs and anticipated profits are not expected to materially change such that the changeswould impact the proposed rate increase.

Under Maryland law, rates may not be inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.  Each rate filing is reviewed on its own merits.  The Commissioner&rsquo;s rate decisions must be based on statistical analysis and reasonable assumptions.  To assist the Commissioner in making these decisions, Maryland Insurance Administration (&ldquo;MIA&rdquo;) actuaries examine the data, methods and assumptions used by each insurer, non-profit health service plan, or HMO (&ldquo;carrier&rdquo;).  They review numerous factors related to proposed premium rates, including the carrier&rsquo;s actual and projected claims experience, medical and prescription costs, administrative costs, and profits or losses.  The Commissioner also considers the impact premium rates will have on Maryland consumers.  Under the federal Affordable Care Act and Maryland law, in the individual and small group markets, 80 cents of every premium dollar must be spent on paying claims or on quality improvement activities that figure increases to 85 cents in the large group market.  If an insurance carrier does not meet these targets, the carrier must pay rebates to policyholders.Modifications to Requested Premium Rates and Basis of ModificationsGroup Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc. submitted a rate filing on May 1, 2014, requesting an average rate increase of 38.1%.  On May 23, 2014, the Company amended its filing to request an average rate increase of 30.2%.  The amended rate filing reflected certain minor adjustments in response to MIA objections, such as modifying its assumptions about projected average age and the projected cost and utilization of dental benefits.  The most significant change, however, was a reduction in the Company&rsquo;s projections about the morbidity of its 2015 individual market enrollees as compared with the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  Specifically, in its amended filing, the Company assigned to its projected 2015 individual market enrollees a morbidity factor that was 1.60 times the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  In its May 1, 2014 filing, the Company had assumed a morbidity factor of 1.75.  The MIA proceeded to review the amended May 23, 2014 filing.The MIA concluded that certain of the Company&rsquo;s data, methods, and assumptions were not well supported, including certain assumptions about the projected morbidity of its individual product enrollees in 2015.  In particular, the Company had not adequately supported its assumptions regarding the number of small group enrollees projected to migrate to its individual products, or its assumptions about the morbidity levels of previously uninsured enrollees.  The MIA further concluded that the Company&rsquo;s actual experience during the first half of 2014, as well as other considerations relating to actual and projected enrollment in the 2014 and 2015 individual market, did not support a 1.60 morbidity factor.  The Commissioner also concluded that the requested average premium rate increase of 30.2% would have an abrupt, substantial, and adverse impact on the approximately 12,714 Marylanders currently enrolled in Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s Affordable Care Act-compliant plans in the individual market, and would introduce a high level of volatility into Maryland&rsquo;s individual health insurance market.The MIA prescribed a morbidity factor of 1.40, rather than the Company&rsquo;s requested morbidity factor of 1.60.  This modification resulted in an approximately 10.6% reduction in the Company&rsquo;s proposed premium rates for 2015.As modified during the rate review process, Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s premium rates for 2015 reflect an approximately 16.2% increase as compared with its premium rates for 2014.&emsp;DeterminationPursuant to&sect; 11-603(c)(2) of the Insurance Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, the Commissioner has determined that the Company&rsquo;s premium rates,  as modified during the rate review process, are not inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.Rate Review Standards and ConsiderationsThe Insurance Commissioner approves health insurance rates in Maryland.

Under the federal Affordable Care Act and Maryland law, in the individual and small group markets, 80 cents of every premium dollar must be spent on paying claims or on quality improvement activities that figure increases to 85 cents in the large group market.  If an insurance carrier does not meet these targets, the carrier must pay rebates to policyholders.Modifications to Requested Premium Rates and Basis of ModificationsCareFirst of Maryland, Inc. submitted a rate filing on May 1, 2014, requesting an average rate increase of 38.1%.  On May 23, 2014, the Company amended its filing to request an average rate increase of 30.2%.  The amended rate filing reflected certain minor adjustments in response to MIA objections, such as modifying its assumptions about projected average age and the projected cost and utilization of dental benefits.  The most significant change, however, was a reduction in the Company&rsquo;s projections about the morbidity of its 2015 individual market enrollees as compared with the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  Specifically, in its amended filing, the Company assigned to its projected 2015 individual market enrollees a morbidity factor that was 1.60 times the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  In its May 1, 2014 filing, the Company had assumed a morbidity factor of 1.75.  The MIA proceeded to review the amended May 23, 2014 filing.The MIA concluded that certain of the Company&rsquo;s data, methods, and assumptions were not well supported, including certain assumptions about the projected morbidity of its individual product enrollees in 2015.  In particular, the Company had not adequately supported its assumptions regarding the number of small group enrollees projected to migrate to its individual products, or its assumptions about the morbidity levels of previously uninsured enrollees.  The MIA further concluded that the Company&rsquo;s actual experience during the first half of 2014, as well as other considerations relating to actual and projected enrollment in the 2014 and 2015 individual market, did not support a 1.60 morbidity factor.  The Commissioner also concluded that the requested average premium rate increase of 30.2% would have an abrupt, substantial, and adverse impact on the approximately 20,179 Marylanders currently enrolled in CareFirst of Maryland, Inc.&rsquo;s Affordable Care Act-compliant plans in the individual market, and would introduce a high level of volatility into Maryland&rsquo;s individual health insurance market.The MIA prescribed a morbidity factor of 1.40, rather than the Company&rsquo;s requested morbidity factor of 1.60.  This modification resulted in an approximately 10.6% reduction in the Company&rsquo;s proposed premium rates for 2015.As modified during the rate review process, CareFirst of Maryland, Inc.&rsquo;s premium rates for 2015 reflect an approximately 16.2% increase as compared with its premium rates for 2014.Final DeterminationPursuant to&sect; 11-603(c)(2) of the Insurance Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, the Commissioner has determined that the Company&rsquo;s premium rates,  as modified during the rate review process, are not inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.",Not Applicable,"CAREFIRST BLUECROSS BLUESHIELD (CF)RATE REVIEW REPORTINGPART II&ndash; WRITTEN EXPLANATION OF RATE INCREASECareFirst submits this rate filing as directed by MIA Order No. 2014-08-008 (the MIA Order).  The rates set forth in this filing were calculated as directed in the MIA Order, and CareFirst believes that they are inadequate.Accordingly, while the rates in this submission are filed as directed by the MIA Order and based upon the prescribed morbidity factor of 1.40, the information contained in this Actuarial Memorandum reflects a morbidity factor of 1.60.1.	SCOPE AND RANGE OF THE RATE INCREASE: CF is proposing to raise annual premiums by 16.2%, prior to age band changes. (For CFI the proposed renewal is 11.9%.) The range is 13.6% to 20.1%. (For renewing customers, an age band change adds 2.6% to the renewal, on average, with a range of 0.0% to 4.7% for ages 22 and upwards per the CMS age curve.)The primary factors driving this proposed change in premium rates are:a)	Projected significant increase in membership volumes with average morbidities higher than 2014.b)	Migration in the pool of former enrollees in Maryland&rsquo;s high risk pool the Maryland Health Insurance Plan (MHIP).c)	An aging of the pool of members.d)	An increase in the cost of medical care delivery in the form of claims trend driven by increases in both unit cost and utilization.e)	An increase in the health insurer fee.2.	FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE OF THE PRODUCT: The incurred period is 1-1-13 through 12-31-13. Total premiums and allowed claims for the period were $53,936,342 and $62,972,468, respectively.A.	Changes in the Morbidity of the Population Insured: CareFirst calculated its proposed rates based upon a morbidity factor of 1.60 however, the rates in this filing are calculated based upon a morbidity factor of 1.40 as ordered by the MIA Order.CareFirst estimates a morbidity risk factor of 1.60 for 2015 as relayed through the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filings (SERFF) on 5-23-14. Our 1.60 factor was computed after consideration for the morbidity risk factor that was included in the 2014 filed and approved rates.  The morbidity risk factor projections are based upon the model that supported CareFirst&rsquo;s 2014 rate filings.  The model compares known and estimated allowed claims costs per member per month (pmpm) for 2013 to project the cost of various categories of the estimated 2015 membership.These categories are based upon the prior status of the 2015 membership - previous CareFirst members (medically underwritten under 65 Individuals, MHIP, Group) and New Entrants sorted by income (less than 200% FPL, greater than 200% FPL).  The risk factor for each category is expressed in terms of allowed claims pmpm cost, and is calculated by comparing the category pmpm claims cost to the 2013 CareFirst Individual membership pmpm cost.  More than 50% of the projected 2015 membership is included in categories supported by actual claims data supporting the previous CareFirst member categories.  The New Entrants&rsquo; categories use projected risk scores based upon a Hilltop study (Basic Health Plan) for the members less than 200% FPL and the Group factor for the greater than 200% FPL members. The Group factor is based upon the almost 250 thousand CareFirst Small Group members that have for decades been community rated and guaranteed issue as is now required under ACA for Individual enrollees. CareFirst&rsquo;s judgment is that this extremely large community rated, guaranteed issue small group pool of members is most representative of the New Entrants greater than 200% FPL.B.	Changes in Demographics: Comparing the overall CareFirst member-level average age as of 12-31-12 to 3-31-14, the average age has increased by 4.5 years from 34.0 to 38.5. Age factors will account for a portion of the corresponding increase in claims cost. We find the CMS age curve spread of 3 to 1 to be lower than the 4.5 to 1 that is more correlated with expected claims costs. We have therefore adjusted expected claims costs accordingly in the experience period (EP) index rate projection in the other category.C.	Trend Factors (Cost-Utilization): The proposed trend of 6.5% is a reduction of 270 basis points from 2014&rsquo;s 9.2%. The improvement is concentrated in outpatient hospital and prescription drug services which comprise 32% of total allowed claims.D.	Projected Loss Ratio: Our projected NAIC DICR for MLR purposes is 83.9%, above the 80.0% minimum of Public Health Service Act (PHSA) 218.3.	CHANGES IN MEDICAL SERVICE COSTS: The experience period index rate is a key component driving the renewal. Last year&rsquo;s implicit 2013 index rate was $211 ($193 x trend of 9.2%). The actual for 2013 is $199 for a favorable variance of -6%.4.	CHANGES IN BENEFITS: For CareFirst&rsquo;s Individual offerings in Maryland, our portfolio is not changing. We will still offer 15 benefit plans&ndash; 1 Young Adult-Catastrophic, 4 Bronze, 4 Silver, 4 Gold and 2 Platinum. We have recalculated the costs of Essential Health Benefits (EHB) as well as Non-EHBs.a)	Per COMAR 31.10.39 Utilization Review of Treatment for Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders, Bulletin 14-07 and due to the passage of SB 759-HB 783, Coverage for Autism Spectrum Disorders, we have calculated an increase in claims of $3 per member per month (PMPM) for 2015. This is largely for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) treatments and is a state-mandated EHB benefit. The $3 PMPM is derived from an incidence assumption of 1 in 68 children ages 1-19, an uptake rate of 1 in 3 and an intensity rate of $40,000 to $95,000 per year depending on age.b)	Other adjustments were made for pediatric dental, mandatory generics, a new hepatitis C prescription drug, Sovaldi, and maternity.c)	Other Adjustments: CareFirst (CF) is proposing to introduce an incentive program (IP) whereby members can earn medical expense debit cards of as much as $250 annually, for an individual ($650 for a family). The cards must be utilized for qualified medical expenses such as deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket costs. The scope includes all benefit plans within CF&rsquo;s portfolio, On and Off the Exchange. This is being done in a revenue-neutral way. That is, the cost to CF of the incentive payments was chosen such that they match the expected savings to CF from more efficacious health care delivery. HealthyBlue (HB) was first launched effective 10-1-10 with the objective of motivating and rewarding greater engagement by the member in his or her health, improved wellness and prevention and better provider coordination and quality. As we sought to respond to feedback about HB, subsequent versions were released on 1-1-12 and 10-1-12. This IP represents an evolution of the HB concept. Further, it joins the tenets of HB with our Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) program which was launched on January, 2011.Our aim is that this IP will improve our members&rsquo; health.d)	Included are decreases to claims costs for a change in our Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) in 2014.e)	Membership Projections: We had projected 58% of enrollment in HMO-based plans as of 12-31-14 in our 2014 filings. Actual data as of 4-10-14 indicates that HMO comprises 69% of our CFI members. We had also expected 5% of enrollment in Platinum plans versus actuals of 13%. We incorporated both of these facts in projecting 12-31-15 enrollment.f)	    For the Young Adult-Catastrophic plan, the deductible-out-of-pocket maximum has been raised from $6,350 to $6,600 per year.g)	Also, per HB 0625, oral chemotherapy coverage has been mandated. The cost of reducing cost shares to not exceed those of intravenous chemotherapy has been deemed negligible.h)	Diabetic supplies have been moved to $0 copays. The deductible applies for H.S.A. plans but not for non-H.S.A.s with negligible price impact.i)	    Retail Clinics such as urgent care centers will have reduced copays to match the PCP rather than specialist copay with negligible price impact.j)	    A 5-tiered structure (Generics-Preferred, Generics-Non-Preferred, Brand Name-Preferred, Brand Name-Non-Preferred, Specialty) is currently used for approximately 20% of our benefits. This is changing to 4-tier structure by collapsing the Generics tiers.5.	ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED CONTRIBUTION TO RESERVE: The 2015 desired incurred claims ratio (DICR) is 79.3%.A.	Administrative Expense Load: PMPMs increased by 3% versus 2014.B.	CtR&amp; Risk Margin: Remains at 0.0%, break-even.C.	Taxes and Fees:I.	Community Health Investment of 2.0%.II.	State Assessment Fees of 0.1%.III.	Federal Income Tax (FIT) of 0.0%.IV.	Health Insurer Fee increased 72.5 basis points to 2.625% considering non-deductibility for tax purposes.V.	PCORI of $2.11 PMPY.VI.	Reinsurance Payments decreased from $5.25 PMPM to $3.67 PMPM.VII.	Risk Adjustment User Fees remained at $0.08 PMPM.VIII.

Therefore, the IID approved the WHPI filing.",Not Applicable,"URRT Part II Description of Requested Rate IncreaseWellmark Health Plan of IowaIndividual HealthEffective January 1, 2015Scope and Range of Rate IncreaseWellmark Health Plan of Iowa, Inc has 2,177 policyholders representing 3,212 members in individual Affordable Care Act, ACA, plans as of May 2014.  The requested average rate increase for all of these plans is 11.9%, and will be effective January 1, 2015. The rate increase varies by plan and region, with a low of 5.9% and a high of 17.5%.  Subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate changes will vary depending on the benefit plan selected, age of the members on the policy, and dependent coverage.Financial Experience of the ProductThese ACA plans were introduced in 2014, and so as of the time of this rate request, there is only a limited amount of experience data available.  Rates for 2015 were therefore based on experience from Wellmark&rsquo;s existing individual business, and projected member movement from the entire insured and uninsured population.From the little claims experience that was available at the time of this rate request, the claims experience is higher for this business than was projected last year.  Therefore the majority of the rate request is due to higher expected claims experience.The proposed rate increase is expected to produce a medical loss ratio, MLR, of 88.8%.  It should be noted that the projected MLR meets the minimum requirement of 80.0% defined in the ACA.  If the actual MLR were to fall below this level, such as if actual claim costs turn out to be lower than expected, Wellmark would pay rebates to members as required by the ACA.Changes in Medical Service CostsAnnual trend of 4.1% was used to project claims from the experience period into the rating period. This trend assumption includes any change in service costs and utilization. Multi year trend averages were reviewed to arrive at the assumed trend amount.Changes in BenefitsThere is one plan that has changes in its benefits effective with this filing for January 1, 2015.For SimplyBlue 5000 HMO, the coinsurance changed from 40% to 30% and the out of pocket amounts changed from $6,250 for single and $12,500 for family to $6,600 for single and $13,200 for family.  There are now any 2 office exam occurrences at a $0 copay instead of 2 primary care office exam occurrences at a $0 copay, and there is an inclusion of a drug card with a tier 1 copay of $15 instead of all drugs applying deductible and coinsurance.Administrative Costs and Anticipated ProfitsThe main drivers of administrative expenses are employee salaries and benefits, broker and agent commissions, and various governmental taxes and fees. We strive to lower our administrative expenses, as well as the underlying cost of care, in order to provide the best value to our customers.For this rate request, administrative costs in aggregate have decreased as a percent of premium from the prior rating period. The same holds for anticipated profit, as it was reduced from 3.3% in the prior rating period to 0.0% in the projected rating period. Typically, a nominal margin is needed to help ensure Wellmark&rsquo;s long term viability.",Review Complete,14.66,25896IA016,SimplyBlue,Wellmark Health Plan of Iowa,IOWA,IA,Annual,14.66,14.66,RC

The company has requested approval for an overall rate increase of 17.8%, to be effective January 1, 2015. The main drivers of the rate increase are changes in average utilization of services and trend.The filing was initially submitted on June 27, 2014, and will be subject to the requirements of the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance Regulations, and the ACA.

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 14.3%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 7,627 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.For Product 65598KS008 current enrollment is 4,391. These members will have an approximate rate increase of 14.0%.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 7.3%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer individuals in Kansas a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes decreased expected medical costs by an average of 3.0%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&#61623;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&#61623; Changes to required taxes and fees&#61623; Phase-out of the Transtional Reinsurance Program which increases rates for plans issued to individualsWill Premiums for All Individuals Increase 14.0%?No, the 14.0 % is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down.  Others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the subscriber chooses, the number of members and their ages, where in Kansas the subscriber is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Individual business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Coventry's secure member portal, My Online Services, which was designed to empower our members to become more involved in their health care by allowing them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services. Additionally, Aetna&rsquo;s Plan for Your Health website aims to educate all consumers, not just Aetna and Coventry members, on how to take advantage of their health care benefits.",Review Complete,16.64,65598KS008,KS POS Individual Wesley Exchange,Coventry Health Care Of Kansas Inc,KANSAS,KS,Annual,16.64,16.64,RC

On July 1, 2014, AZDOI found the increase unjustified and therefore, not reasonable.  AZDOI closed the SERFF filing with a determination status of, Filed Health Rates, Unreasonable Threshold.  AZDOI entered in HIOS submission 86830-125018 its final determination regarding the finding of unreasonable.Per Arizona&rsquo;s Individual market threshold rate increase rule, AAC R20-6-2304, CIGNA requested to file a modified lower threshold rate increase.  On July 25, 2014, AZDOI reopened SERFF filing CCGH-129522721, and CIGNA filed the modified increase.  As the original HIOS submission 86830-125018 had been closed out, CIGNA submitted its Rates Justifications for the modified increase, as required by 45 CFR Part 154, under new HIOS submission 86830-758926.  CIGNA&rsquo;s modified threshold rate filing requested an overall increase of 11.2 percent (Minimum -5 percent, Maximum 17 percent, Weighted Average 11.2 percent).  The requested increase is to be effective January 1, 2015, and applies to CIGNA&rsquo;s individual PPO products, marketed on and off the Exchange.AZDOI requested that its consulting actuaries at Gabriel, Roeder, Smith and Company (GRS) review the modified lower rate increase.  GRS found that CIGNA provided adequate justification, and that the modified increase was reasonable in relation to the benefits provided.  Based on this actuarial opinion and AZDOI&rsquo;s review of the rate increase, AZDOI found the requested rate increase to be reasonable under AAC R20-6-607, AAC R20-6-2301 through R20-6-2305, and 45 CFR Part 154.  Additionally, Arizona&rsquo;s individual threshold rate increase rule, AAC R20-6-2301(B)(15), lists five factors that are relevant to finding an increase unreasonable.  None of the five factors applied to this filing.Accordingly, CIGNA&rsquo;s modified rate increase is filed on August 18, 2014 for implementation in Arizona, effective July 1, 2015.  On August 18, 2014, AZDOI closed for the second time SERFF filing CCGH-129522721 and assigned a disposition status to the filing of, Filed Health Rates, Reasonable Modified Threshold.",Not Applicable,"GENERAL INFORMATIONCigna is filing rates for Individual plans in Arizona effective January 2015 through December 2015. The proposed rate increases exceed the subject to review threshold in 45 CFR 154.200. In accordance with the requirements in 45 CFR 154.215 this document describes the justification for the increase in the rates.SIGNIFICANT FACTORSThe most significant factors requiring the rate increase are:Claim Cost Trend: The increasing cost of medical services accounts for the majority of the premium rate increases. We anticipate that the cost of medical services (reflecting unit cost and utilization) in 2015 will increase over the 2014 level.Network Adjustments: The changes in network contracts or provider payment mechanisms account for part of the premium rate increases.Morbidity (Risk Pool) Adjustments: The marketplace for non-grandfathered individual plans is affected by changes brought about by provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act) that became effective in 2014, including:guarantee issue and renewal requirementsmodified community- rating requirementfederal premium subsidies for low and moderate income individuals.The effects of these 2014 changes when coupled with previous regulatory changes and early indications of utilization thus far in 2014 suggest that it is appropriate to increase the overall claim level assumption reflected in the premiums for individual plans in Arizona.EXPERIENCE&amp; PROJECTIONSNon-grandfathered individual plans subject to the changes brought about by Affordable Care Act have only been effective since January 1, 2014. As a result, our claim experience with respect to these individual plans at the time of this filing is immature. Cigna expects, however, that loss ratios for its individual plans in Arizona will be in excess of the federally defined minimum loss ratio threshold of 80% in 2014. Even with the proposed 2015 rate increase, we expect that the loss ratios for our individual plans to exceed the federally defined minimum loss ratio threshold of 80%, thereby ensuring that the amount of premium spent on claims and quality improvement activities is more than required by the Affordable Care Act.Cigna's COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE WE SERVECigna&rsquo;s view is that the objectives of improved health, quality and cost with a focus on the individual are all closely aligned with the company&rsquo;s mission and strategy for a sustainable and affordable healthcare system. Cigna&rsquo;s entry in this market reflects its principles, and Cigna&rsquo;s plans are designed to help individuals:Navigate the complex world of healthcare to access the best and most cost-effective care.Find the right family doctor from top-rated local networks which are increasingly aligned to innovative partnerships centered around the highest-performing, value-based physician networksCigna&rsquo;s nurses, service people and information are there when customers need it 24-7-365 via phone, online, and Cigna's new consumer apps.These capabilities are available to all of Cigna&rsquo;s 14 million-plus US customers: from the Fortune 500 CEO to the individual purchasing a health plan for the first time on their local public marketplace exchange.In the individual and family plan market, Cigna is making a dedicated effort to outreach and engage its customers starting with a robust onboarding program. For example, through this outreach Cigna is increasingly helping more people find quality care providers who are both cost efficient while using evidence based medicine best practices. Cigna will help those who require prescription medications to identify generic equivalent medications to save them hundreds of dollars annually and for those who may have a chronic illness, Cigna puts them in touch with its medical management nurses to help them navigate the system for better, healthier, outcomes.",Review Complete,11.20,86830AZ004,AZ_IND_Local Plus,Cigna Health and Life Insurance Company,ARIZONA,AZ,Annual,11.15,11.15,RC

We strive to lower our administrative expenses, as well as the underlying cost of care, in order to provide the best value to our customers.For this rate request, administrative costs in aggregate have decreased as a percent of premium from the prior rating period. The same holds for anticipated profit, as it was reduced from 3.3% in the prior rating period to 0.0% in the projected rating period.

Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer individuals in Illinois a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes increased expected medical costs by an average of 1.4%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates.

Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Individual business.

In this filing, the company included appropriate rate justifications to demonstrate their rate changes were not unreasonable given the company assumptions about the future, and the experience and enrollment data available to the company at the time of the filing.",Not Applicable,"GENERAL INFORMATIONCigna is filing rates for Individual plans in Florida effective January 2015 through December 2015.  The proposed rate increases exceed the subject to review threshold in 45 CFR 154.200. In accordance with the requirements in 45 CFR 154.215 this document describes the justification for the increase in the rates.SIGNIFICANT FACTORSThe most significant factors requiring the rate increase are:Claim Cost Trend: The increasing cost of medical services accounts for the majority of the premium rate increases.  We anticipate that the cost of medical services (reflecting unit cost and utilization) in 2015 will increase over the 2014 level.Transitional Reinsurance Program Changes: The federally mandated transitional reinsurance program is in effect for three years (2104, 2015, and 2016). The amount of funding available to issuers under the reinsurance program to offset adverse claim experience decreases each year ($10B in 2014, $6B in 2015, and $4B in 2016).  Additional premium is required to compensate for the reduced reinsurance support in 2015.Network Adjustments: Changes in network contracts or provider payment mechanisms account for part of the premium rate increases.Morbidity (Risk Pool) Adjustments: The  marketplace for non-grandfathered individual plans is affected by changes brought about by provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the&ldquo;Affordable Care Act&rdquo;) that became effective in 2014, including:guarantee issue and renewal  requirementsmodified community- rating requirementFederal premium subsidies for low and moderate income individuals.The effects of these 2014 changes when coupled with previous regulatory changes (e.g., transitional policy allowances) and early indications of utilization thus far in 2014 suggest that it is appropriate to increase the overall claim level assumption reflected in the premiums for individual plans in Florida.EXPERIENCE&amp; PROJECTIONSNon-grandfathered individual plans subject to the changes brought about by Affordable Care Act have only been effective since January 1, 2014. As a result, our claim experience with respect to these individual plans at the time of this filing is immature.  Cigna expects, however, that loss ratios for its individual plans in Florida will be in excess of the federally defined minimum loss ratio threshold of 80% in 2014.  Even with the proposed 2015 rate increase, we expect that the loss ratios for our individual plans to exceed the federally defined minimum loss ratio threshold of 80%, thereby ensuring that the amount of premium spent on claims and quality improvement activities is more than required by the Affordable Care Act.Cigna's COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE WE SERVECigna&rsquo;s view is that the objectives of improved health, quality and cost with a focus on the individual are all closely aligned with the company&rsquo;s mission and strategy for a sustainable and affordable healthcare system. Cigna&rsquo;s entry in this market reflects its principles, and Cigna&rsquo;s plans are designed to help individuals:Navigate the complex world of healthcare to access the best and most cost-effective care.Find the right family doctor from top-rated local networks which are increasingly aligned to innovative partnerships centered around the highest-performing, value-based physician networksCigna&rsquo;s nurses, service people and information are there when customers need it 24-7-365 via phone, online, and Cigna's new consumer apps.These capabilities are available to all of Cigna&rsquo;s 14 million-plus US customers: from the Fortune 500 CEO to the individual purchasing a health plan for the first time on their local public marketplace exchange.In the individual and family plan market, Cigna is making a dedicated effort to outreach and engage its customers starting with a robust onboarding program.  For example, through this outreach Cigna is increasingly helping more people find quality care providers who are both cost efficient while using evidence based medicine best practices. Cigna will help those who require prescription medications to identify generic equivalent medications to save them hundreds of dollars annually and for those who may have a chronic illness, Cigna puts them in touch with its medical management nurses to help them navigate the system for better, healthier, outcomes.",Review Complete,16.79,48121FL002,FL_IND_Local Plus,Cigna Health and Life Insurance Company,FLORIDA,FL,Annual,16.79,16.79,RC

The company has requested approval for an overall rate increase of 11.6%, to be effective January 1, 2015. The main drivers of the rate increase are changes in morbidity and trend.In support of their request, HIC has provided premium rates, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template, a Part II Preliminary Justification of Rate Increase and a Part III Actuarial Memorandum. The Actuarial Memorandum included, inter alia, actuarial assumptions, anticipated loss ratios, other information required by the ACA and appropriate actuarial certifications.INS has reviewed the submission in its entirety. However, INS has given special consideration in its review to the details of the Company&rsquo;s Part III Actuarial Memorandum, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template and the characteristics of the rating elements subject to the Federal regulations prescribed in 45CFR Part 147 paragraph 147.102.  Based on that review, INS has come to the following key conclusions:URRT Section 1 Experience Period Data&bull;	Earned premiums, incurred claims, allowed claims and index rate per member per month (PMPM) for the experience period, January 2013 through December 2013, appear normal&bull;	The completion method used to determine estimated incurred claims and allowed claims is consistent with accepted actuarial methods&bull;	Member months for the Experience Period, 125,768, is expected to increase to 161,017 for the Projection Period. The company based its projection on in-force persistency, anticipated market growth and the competitiveness of its product. Based on the narrative provided by the company, the projection appears reasonable.URRT Section II Allowed Claims, PMPM Basis&bull;	Benefit Category descriptions closely follow the preferred descriptions of the URRT instructions&bull;	The utilization per 1,000 and the average cost/service factors by benefit category for the Experience Period appear to be average for the Small Group market&bull;	The total allowed PMPM claim cost of $340.10 (Section II) matches the index rate of $340.00 (Section I) for the experience period (difference due to rounding)&bull;	The overall annual Trend assumption of 6.2% was developed from both the company&rsquo;s own small group experience. Based on the narrative provided in the Actuarial Memorandum, the trend assumption appears to be reasonable.&bull;	HIC used a&lsquo;Population Risk Morbidity&rsquo; factor of 1.076 to project their underlying experience. Based on the narrative and chart provided by the company, INS believes the 1.076 Morbidity factor to be reasonable&bull;	The&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factor used by HIC to project their underlying experience was set to 1.105. The main drivers behind this factor were:1.	Additional benefits to meet the Essential Health Benefit (EHB) guidelines2.	Induced utilization3.	Changes in demographicsBased on the narrative and chart provided by the company, INS believes the 1.105&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factor to be reasonable.URRT Section II Credibility Manual&bull;	Because HIC considers its experience data to be 100% credible, the company did not create a Credibility Manual.URRT Section III Projected Experience&bull;	HIC considers 120,000 member months of experience to be 100% credible. Because it had over 125,000 member months during the Experience Period, the experience data is considered 100% credible. INS believes this to be reasonable&bull;	The method used to determine the&lsquo;Paid to Allowed Average Factor in the Projection Period&rsquo; of 71.0% is actuarially acceptable and such average factor is consistent with both the Experience Period data and the&lsquo;paid to allowed&rsquo; ratios at the plan level&bull;	Companies are allowed to make a Risk Adjustment in developing its incurred claims on the URRT. Risk adjustment calculates a risk score for each plan participant, based upon age, sex and diagnosis. This is used to calculate the company&rsquo;s Plan average risk score. If the Plan average risk score is higher than the average risk score for the state, the Company will receive payment for having a higher risk population. Because HIC anticipates its market level risk scores to be consistent with the Tennessee market, its Risk Adjustment is 0. However, due to changes in the URRT instructions for 2015, the $.08 Risk Adjustment Fee appears as -.08 on the Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM line in Worksheet 1, Section III of the URRT&bull;	HIC has an expectant gross reinsurance recovery of zero, since small group business does not participate in the reinsurance program. Please note, however, that the URRT correctly shows the reinsurance fee that small group insurers must pay&bull;	The combined&lsquo;Administrative Expense Load&rsquo;,&lsquo;Profit&amp; Risk Load&rsquo; and&lsquo;Taxes&amp; Fees&rsquo; appear average for the Small Group market&bull;	The&lsquo;Index Rate for Projection Period&rsquo; of $467.75 differs from the&lsquo;Projected Allowed Experience Claims PMPM&rsquo; of $456.36.

The actual increase experienced by a group upon renewal will vary depending on the age and gender makeup of the group, their location, the group&rsquo;s current underwriting status, their current plan, and the Affordable Care Act compliant plan they choose to select upon renewal.  The ranges of impacts due to rate changes requested in this filing are as a result of the following parameters.Elimination of rating groups due to the health status of their members.Elimination of gender rating.Changes to allow no greater than a 3 to 1 difference in premium between adult ages 21 to 64, and prescribed adult and child age rating factors established by HHS.Implementation of single year age bands for adults 21 to 64.Changes to the method of rating to calculate group rates at a member level.  Elimination of composite rating and counting no more than three child dependents toward a family premium.Changes in the pricing values of specific benefit designs.New geographic pricing regions and updated geography pricing factors that no longer allow or make use of a region&rsquo;s overall health status in pricing.Groups that are on plans below the minimum allowed benefit level or that will need to move to a more generous level of plan cost sharing as a result of ACA requirements.Groups that need to move to new plan designs to remain within mandated ranges in benefit levels, for example, prescribed metal levels of benefits.The impact for groups will range from a 41 percent reduction to a 284 percent increase.  This does not reflect any impacts due to member aging, and is based on the sample of 2013 groups that have renewed with us through March of this year.  This includes required benefit changes.  Before the required changes, the largest increase would be 249 percent.  The ultimate range of impacts will vary depending on the profile of groups that will continue to renew throughout the year, or changes in the age make-up of our groups.This filing impacts 233,950 members currently enrolled in our Small Group market as of March 2013.Financial Experience for the ProductIn 2010, BCBSNC collected 1108.8 million in revenue and paid 919.0 million in claims for Small Groups.  The operating income before federal income tax was 22.7 million or 2 percent of revenue.In 2011, BCBSNC collected 1067.0 million in revenue and paid 883.0 million in claims for Small Groups.  The operating income before federal income tax was 29.5 million or 2.8 percent of revenue.In 2012, BCBSNC collected 1024.3 million in revenue and paid 837.2 million in claims for Small Groups.  The operating income before federal income tax was 38.1 million or 3.7 percent of revenue.The projected rate action is estimated to result in 1211.5 million in revenue based on current membership with anticipated paid claims of 966.3 million 2014.  We expect this rate action to deliver a 3 percent of gross revenue in contribution to surplus prior to federal income tax.  Favorable financial experience has allowed us to reduce premiums by .2 percent.Changes in Medical Service CostsThe cost of providing medical care to our members is by far the largest portion of premium expense.  The following changes in medical service costs and utilization contribute to the overall rate increase.Increases in both unit costs and utilization of knee and hip surgeries.Increases in outpatient costs per visit of 8.1 percent, driven primarily by gastroenterology costs and orthopedic costs.Increases in outpatient utilization of .8 percent, driven by chemical dependency services.Increases in professional costs of 2.5 percent, driven heavily by treatment of GERD and colonoscopies, and endocrinology treatments for obesity.Increases in professional utilization of 1.1 percent, due to increases in office visits, including mental health treatment.Increases in pharmacy costs per prescription of 2.1 percent due to increases in use of high cost, specialty medications.  Increases in specialty drug costs alone rose by 15.5 percent in 2012 compared to a decline in non specialty drug costs on a per member per month basis.In total, changes in the underlying cost of providing medical services to our current members add 7.1 percent to our rate increase.Changes in utilization patterns, primarily driven by the elimination of copayments once the member out of pocket maximum is reached, and the overall expected risk of our Small Group pool in 2014 add an additional 1.5 percent combined.Changes in BenefitsAdditional benefits will add 4.7 percent to the rate increase in 2014.BCBSNC has developed new plans to remain compliant with the Affordable Care Act.  These plans eliminate dollar limits on any essential health benefits and implement out of pocket maximiums that limit any type of member of out of pocket cost, including copayments, as required by law.  Furthermore, groups will need to move to a plan compliant with federally required ranges for plan cost sharing or actuarial value. Upon renewal,  groups will be presented a renewal with a default plan most comparable to their current plan.  Groups will have a choice of any plan offered in the market, however, the rate increase presented in this filing reflects the extimated overall impact of the change in premium including any required changes in benefit design, as described above.  The required changes in design add 3.5 percent to the rate increase.  Please note that we have reduced the number of benefit designs offered in the market in order to comply with mandated levels of benefits, which means certain combinations of benefit levels currently offered in the market will no longer be available.Additionally, Small Group members will receive coverage of pediatric dental and vision benefits which add another 1.2 percent to the rate increase.  These benefits are required to be covered as essential health benefits under the Affordable Care Act.Changes in administrative costs and profitNew taxes and fees required by the Affordable Care Act have an impact on rates.  These include the Health Insurer Tax, Transitional Reinsurance Fee, the Federal Exchange User Fee, Patient Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund Fee, and the federal Risk Adjustment Program Fee.  In total, these fees and taxes add 2.3 percent to the premiums for Small Groups in 2014.  Groups renewing earlier in the year will be more adversely impacted by these taxes and fees than groups renewing later in the year.Other changes to non claims expenses such as administrative expenses, commission payments to brokers and agents, and contributions to surplus in total add 1.4 percent to the rate increase.Addressing AffordabilityBlue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina is committed to reducing medical premium costs for owners of Small businesses in North Carolina and improving the health of our policyholders.

These trend factors affect health insurance premiums, which can mean a premium rate increase to cover costs.  Some of the key health care cost trends that have affected this year&rsquo;s rate actions include:Coverage Mandates&ndash; Estimated impacts of changes in benefit design and administration due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act mandates.  Direct impacts include the effects of specific changes made to comply with new laws both at the Federal and State level.Increasing Cost of Medical Services&ndash; Annual increases in reimbursement rates to health care providers&ndash; such as hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical companies.Increased Utilization&ndash; The number of office visits and other services continues to grow.  In addition, total health care spending will vary by the intensity of care and or use of different types of health services. Patients who are sicker generally have a higher intensity of health care utilization. The price of care can be affected by the use of expensive procedures such as surgery vs. simply monitoring or providing medications.Higher Costs from Deductible Leveraging&ndash; Health care costs continue to rise every year, while deductibles and copayments remain the same.  As a result, a greater percentage of health care costs need to be covered by health insurance premiums each year.Cost shifting from the public to the private sector&ndash; Reimbursements from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to hospitals are no longer covering all of the cost of care.  The cost difference is being shifted to private health plans. Additionally, Medicare and Medicaid rates to hospitals are expected to decline due to the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on Medicare and the effect of the recession on Medicaid.  A rate increase paid by Medicaid to hospitals is often below the actual cost increase hospitals will experience.Impact of New Technology - Improvements to medical technology and clinical practice require use of more expensive services - leading to increased health care spending and utilization.Underwriting Wear Off&ndash; The variation by policy duration in individual medical insurance claims, where claims are higher at later policy durations as more time has elapsed since initial underwriting.Administrative CostsGolden Rule Insurance Company works to directly control administrative expenses by adopting better processes and technology, and through the development of programs and innovations that make health care more affordable. We have led the marketplace by introducing key innovations that make health care services more accessible and affordable for customers, improve the quality and coordination of health care services, and help individuals and their physicians make more informed health care decisions.Additionally, Golden Rule indirectly controls medical cost payments by using appropriate payment structures with providers and facilities. Golden Rule&rsquo;s goal is to control costs, maximize efficiency, and work closely with physicians and providers to obtain the best value and coverage.In addition, increases in State and or Federal government imposed taxation and fees are another significant factor that impacts health care spending.A review of the current Golden Rule premium rate indicates that the rate is not sufficient to cover the projected benefit and administrative costs.

Our new filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 15% for this product only.  The rate increase is effective 8-1-13.Who This Change Will AffectThe rates will apply to policies that renew or start from July 2013 through December 2013.  The rates will go into effect on August 1, 2013.  Approximately 1,800 members currently are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply.  This product will not be available to new subscribers in 2014.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase.  We expect medical costs to go up 12.4%.  Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.  We expect approximately half of the medical cost increase to come from providers raising prices,  a third to come from members getting more care, and the remaining portion to come from cost sharing that does not increase as quickly as medical costs.  The additional part of the rate increase is needed due to the higher than expected prior claims.For this Association, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&bull;	The cost of inpatient hospital services has increased by 17.8%&bull;	The use of inpatient hospital services has increased by 18.3%&bull;	The use of emergency treatment services has increased by 14.5%Impact of New Taxes and FeesThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes several new taxes and fees payable in 2014, including two that specifically apply to insured products -- the health insurer fee and the reinsurance contribution. These new fees result in additional costs and are reflected in our updated rates for policies that extend into 2014.  The overall impact of these costs on this filing is as follows:&bull;	Health Insurer Fee: 1.42%&bull;	Reinsurance Contribution: 0.42%Will Premiums for All Individuals in Texas Increase 15%?No, the 15% is only for the members of this Association effective 8-1-13.   The increase will be the same for all members.How Does This Request Match up with Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Individual business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.It should be noted that Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna Doing to Keep Premiums Affordable?Aetna is taking a number of steps to mitigate&ldquo;rate shock&rdquo; and address the underlying cost of health care, such as:&bull;	Developing new agreements, arrangements or partnerships with health care providers that compensate them for the quality of care they provide, and not the quantity of services.&bull;	Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Aetna Navigator, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services.

These trend factors affect health insurance premiums, which can mean a premium rate increase to cover costs.  Some of the key health care cost trends that have affected this year&rsquo;s rate actions include:&#61607;	Increasing Cost of Medical Services&ndash; Annual increases in reimbursement rates to health care providers&ndash; such as hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical companies.&#61607;	Increased Utilization&ndash; The number of office visits and other services continues to grow.  In addition, total health care spending will vary by the intensity of care and use of different types of health services. Patients who are sicker generally have a higher intensity of health care utilization. The price of care can be affected by the use of expensive procedures such as surgery vs. simply monitoring or providing medications.&#61607;	Higher Costs from Deductible Leveraging&ndash; Health care costs continue to rise every year, while deductibles and copayments remain the same.  As a result, a greater percentage of health care costs need to be covered by health insurance premiums each year.&#61607;	Cost shifting from the public to the private sector&ndash; Reimbursements from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to hospitals are no longer covering all of the cost of care.  The cost difference is being shifted to private health plans. Additionally, Medicare and Medicaid rates to hospitals are expected to decline due to the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on Medicare and the effect of the recession on Medicaid.  A rate increase paid by Medicaid to hospitals is often below the actual cost increase hospitals will experience.&#61607;	Impact of New Technology - Improvements to medical technology and clinical practice require use of more expensive services - leading to increased health care spending and utilization.&#61607;	Underwriting Wear Off&ndash; The variation by policy duration in individual medical insurance claims, where claims are higher at later policy durations as more time has elapsed since initial underwriting.Changes in BenefitsThere have been no premium changes due to benefit changes in this filing.Administrative CostsGolden Rule Insurance Company works to directly control administrative expenses by adopting better processes and technology, and through the development of programs and innovations that make health care more affordable. We have led the marketplace by introducing key innovations that make health care services more accessible and affordable for customers, improve the quality and coordination of health care services, and help individuals and their physicians make more informed health care decisions.Additionally, Golden Rule indirectly controls medical cost payments by using appropriate payment structures with providers and facilities. Golden Rule&rsquo;s goal is to control costs, maximize efficiency, and work closely with physicians and providers to obtain the best value and coverage.In addition, increases in State and Federal government imposed taxation and fees are another significant factor that impacts health care spending.These fees include new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) taxes and fees which will increase health insurance costs and need to be reflected in premium.  The two largest cost impacts both take effect with calendar year 2014 earned premiums:&bull;	Insurer Fee: UnitedHealthcare estimates 2014 premium will need to be increased by 1.6% to cover this fee and the associated additional federal income tax.&bull;	Reinsurance Fee: UnitedHealthcare estimates 2014 premium will need to be increased by $5.25 per member per month.  This results in an increase for 2014 premium of 2.8%.A review of the current Golden Rule premium rate indicates that the rate is not sufficient to cover the benefit and administrative costs.

The average increase will be approximately 18% and will vary somewhat by plan due to the way medical inflation is amplified or dampened by plan parameters such as deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums.2) Key Drivers of IncreaseThe main drivers of the requested 18% rate increase are medical inflation (approximately 8%), experience worse than that expected in previous pricing (approximately 10%), deductible leveraging (approximately 2%) and plan indexing (approximately -1%, more detail in the next section).Analysis of this block of business indicated a 10% increase for experience worse than expected. Due to the low volume of data available and in order to reduce the impact to policyholders, this was limited to 7.5%.3) Change in BenefitsAll MIC long-term contracts include a provision for indexing of deductibles and out-of-pocket (OOP) maximums in order to observe Federal HSA indexing requirements for HSA compatible plans and to minimize the need for future rate increases on the remainder of the long-term portfolio.

This is an increase of $348.16 from the average current rate. There is estimated to be one customer impacted by this rate increase over the course of next year.The premium increase to the one existing customer will be 36.1%.

However, rates are being updated to ensure compliance with ACA regulations which includes being compliant with the federally designated age slope. Therefore, on average, individuals younger than 53 would expect to see rate decreases while other individuals are expected to see rate increases versus the current rates.Financial Experience of CIGNA HealthCare of Connecticut Individual Conversion Products:For the experience period, Cigna only had one member on its Connecticut Individual conversion plan, and does not believe its past experience to be credible.How Legally Required Benefit Changes contribute to the rate increase:Benefit changes in order to comply with ACA regulations have contributed 19.2% of the rate increase. These changes include the addition of essential health benefits (including pediatric dental and vision benefits), restrictions on the out of pocket max, and adjustments to meet actuarial value requirements.How administrative costs&amp; anticipated profits contribute to the rate increase:In addition to the cost of medical services, there are a number of indirect medical and non-medical costs that an insurance company has to pay. These costs are as a result of programs that promote the best level of care and health for a patient, payments that must be made to federal, state or local government authorities in the form of taxes or fees, assessments or subsidies that states charge to pay for public health programs, e.g. childhood vaccines, financial examinations by the government, prevention of healthcare fraud, payments to agents or brokers who help customers enroll in a health plan and other costs that all businesses have such as employees&rsquo; salaries, building upkeep, utilities, etc.There are new fees as a result of ACA regulations that contribute to the overall increase.

This is projected to affect 46,700 members.Relative to 2014 pricing, the projected 2015 population is expected to have a higher morbidity and higher average age.

(NAIC code number 55107) has applied to the Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services to adjust premium rates for its community-rated small group and individual qualified health plans.I. OVERVIEWThe rates being sought contain a zero percent operating margin for the health plan despite the health plan reporting operating losses in 2013 and a forecasted significant operating loss in 2014. The proposed rate adjustment is based on the need to adjust prospectively from the state&rsquo;s reduction of rates by 6.3% on small group qualified health plans and by 4.0% on individual qualified health plans for 2014, an increasing medical cost trend, and changes in the health insurance market driven by federal and state actions. Other contributing factors for the proposed 2015 rate adjustment include increases in fees, taxes and added coverage for new mandated benefits.Excellus Health Plan and related companies (EHP) provide health insurance and administrative services for about 1.8 million upstate New Yorkers in 39 counties. The proposed premium rates affect about 182,000 members or 10% of the health plan&rsquo;s total membership. Its proposed rates are subject to review by the New York Department of Financial Services pursuant to section 4308c of the New York Insurance Law. The Department may approve the proposed rate increase as requested, modify the proposed rate increase, or disapprove the proposed rate increase in its entirety. The determination by the Department shall be supported by sound actuarial assumptions and methods.The rate application will be filed with the Department on or about June 13, 2014. The actual rate increases approved by the Department will be communicated to the impacted parties at least 60 days prior to the date the new rate is implemented for the subscriber. EHP policyholders with renewal dates during 2015 would, if approved, receive the indicated rate adjustments on their next anniversary date on or after January 1, 2015.Excellus Health Plan is required by New York State law to develop rates that assume that at least 82% of premium revenue will be spent on health care costs in the direct pay market along with small groups, be actuarially sound, cover all claim costs, and provide a contribution to ensure adequate reserves. The percent of premium attributable to claims is referred to as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).Excellus Health Plan's MLR has been and continues to exceed the statutory minimums. In 2013, the MLR for Excellus Health Plan was 94.2% for individual direct pay and 91.0% for small groups. Under new reporting requirements for 2014, the three-year cumulative MLR is 94.4% for individual direct pay and 91.5% for small group qualified health plans. With the proposed rate adjustments, Excellus Health Plan's MLRs would remain well above the minimum levels. In the event the MLR falls below the required minimum, the health plan refunds any difference to policyholders.Periodic rate adjustments are necessary to secure the ability of Excellus Health Plan, or any insurer, to produce sufficient revenue and surplus for reserves to assure continued coverage and claim payments both for current health care needs, and potential catastrophic cost situations. Excellus Health Plan's reserves vary from year to year based on actual health care costs incurred. As of Dec. 31, 2013, the health plan had reserves equivalent to 2.5 months of claims and operating expense, and more than the minimum required by New York State law. These reserves are the insurance that assures payment even when costs run higher than anticipated, or emergencies or disasters occur, and should not be used as an alternative fund to temporarily reduce rate adjustments.In filing its rate application, Excellus Health Plan is sensitive to the fact that individuals and small businesses struggle to afford higher premiums. However, it is clear that an increase in premiums is necessary to assure the continued operations of the Plan and the viability of its product offerings. Because EHP already has a high MLR, failure to approve these rates would only lead to the need for even greater rate increases in the future as claim costs would eventually exceed premiums collected.II. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASEEscalating health care costsThe cost of health care services, equipment and products continues to be the primary reason for rate increases.Trend is a very important consideration in determining the need for a premium rate adjustment. Upstate New York is not immune to national trends in health care costs given our state&rsquo;s population and demographics. Industry experts such as Segal Consulting and Buck Consultants are forecasting a 7.2-10.4% medical benefit trend nationwide for 2014. EHP is forecasting an overall medical benefit trend factor for its commercial fully insured business of 6.8% for 2014-2015. The trend forecast takes into account projected increases in costs attributed to what Excellus Health Plan pays out in claims expenses for hospital inpatient and outpatient care, professional services, pharmacy benefits and other goods and services. The health plan&rsquo;s anticipated changes in medical benefit spending are summarized as follows:Hospital inpatient, 6.9%Hospital outpatient, 6.4%Professional services, 4.5%Pharmacy, 10.6%Other medical goods and services, 7.5%These trends do not include adjustments to base rates for previous rate increases that were insufficient to cover claims and operating expenses for some plan options.Health care costs for each of those benefit components take into account the compounding effects of both the price of the goods or services provided as well as the quantity of the goods and services consumed.The impact that each trend has to the overall cost of coverage is related to proportionate size of the benefit component. For example, overall spending would rise faster as a result of a 5% increase in professional services versus a 5% increase in drug costs because professional services represents a larger share of medical benefit spending.III. NEW YORK TAXES AND ASSESSMENTSInsurance taxes are built into the costs of health coverage. New Yorkers who voluntarily purchase private health insurance coverage paid more than $4 billion in state health taxes in 2011, according to an analysis by the New York State Conference of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans.New York&rsquo;s Health Care Reform Act of 1996 (HCRA) created two surcharges on health insurance and an additional tax is imposed under Section 206 (formerly Section 332) of the state Insurance Law.The covered lives assessment is an annual flat surcharge or tax on every person who has insurance coverage in the state. Health plans are assessed on the basis of the number of people they cover with individual and family rates that vary depending on the residence of the insured. Among upstate regions defined by the state, the annual covered lives assessment rates in 2014 that impact Excellus Health Plan members are as follows:Per Certificate Per Year by region (Individual : Family)Western: $39.40: $130.03Rochester: $105.72: $348.87Central: $55.59: $183.46Utica-Watertown: $8.54: $28.17Northeastern: $39.94: $131.79The second surcharge created by the 1996 Health Care Reform Act is collected from health plans in the form of a sales tax on many hospital-related services. The surcharge is applied to both self-insured and fully insured plans. Beginning at 8.18% in 1997, the surcharge is now at 9.63%.The third levy, the Section 206 assessment, was originally established to finance New York State Department of Insurance operations but its funding purposes have expanded beyond that purpose. The assessments apply to all licensed insurers in the state (e.g. life, property and casualty, and health), and are based on New York premiums.In total, the above New York taxes and assessments including Section 206 aggregated to nearly 6% of the 2015 small group and individual qualified health plans&rsquo; premium.IV. FEDERAL TAXES, MANDATES AND ADJUSTMENTSAnnual fee on health insurance providers:Beginning in 2014, this fee is based on each health insurance company&rsquo;s market share of net premiums written, adjusted for size and corporate structure.The federal law requires the total fee on nationwide health insurance providers to be collected is:$8 billion in 2014,$11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016,$13.9 billion in 2017, and$14.3 billion in 2018.After 2018, the fee is expected to collect $14.3 billion, indexed to the rate of growth in premiums.Each year, the calculation will be based on the market share of each assessed plan and will change based on the number of companies in the insured market. Under this fee provision, a health plan could incur financial losses but would still be subject to the market share fee.For EHP, this fee increase represents a 1.2% increase to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans for 2015.Risk Adjustment Program:The risk adjustment program is a permanent provision that applies to both the individual and small group insurance market. This federal program assesses a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and uses the revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members.A fee of $0.96 per member per year is collected to fund the risk adjustment program. For EHP, this program reduces small group qualified health plans&rsquo; premiums by about 1.5%. For 2015, this program has no impact on the premium of individual direct pay qualified health plans.Transitional reinsurance program for the individual market:The federal law created a temporary reinsurance program that is to collect nationwide:$10 billion in 2014,$6 billion in 2015, and$4 billion in 2016.Additionally, a separate contribution is to be deposited into the U.S. Treasury that will total $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016.The contribution rate is to be based on a $44 national per capita yearly amount in 2015. All insurers and self- insured group health plans are required to contribute on behalf of all group health plans and health insurance coverage they provide. For EHP, this fee represents about 1% of premium but it is about 40% less than last year resulting in a 0.5% decrease to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans in 2015.For the individual qualified health plans, the federal government established reinsurance for excessive claims. The amount of money being distributed in 2014 is being reduced in 2015. At the same time, this reduction will require a 3.8% premium increase for individual qualified health plans.Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) fee:The federal law created the PCORI to help stakeholders make informed health decisions by advancing the quality and relevance of evidence-based medicine through the use of comparative clinical effectiveness research findings. The fee is set at $2 per year multiplied by the average number of lives covered under the plan for plan years ending before October 1, 2014. And, for plan years ending on or after October 1, 2014, the fee increases based on the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures.Federal mental health mandateThe federal requirements for coverage of mental health parity require a 0.2% increase to current premium to pay for required benefits in 2015.V. OPERATING EXPENSE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTSA portion of what is reported to the state as administrative expenses is attributed to what Federal Health Reform considers quality improvement expenses, meaning the federal government recognizes that these represent costs that lead to overall improvements in health care versus simply a routine business expense, and as a result will be considered a medical benefit expense for purposes of federal MLR calculations.Those quality improvement expenses include such items as:-Improvements in health outcomes brought about by case management and disease management programs,-Actions taken to help prevent hospital readmissions through such things as discharge planning and counseling,-Wellness and community health promotional activities, and-Health information technology that is used to help measure clinical effectiveness and predictive modeling.The proposed rates will more accurately reflect the true operating expense of administering the federal Health Care Reform legislation through the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange. The changes in the health insurance market required building and implementing an entirely new sales channel from what had primarily been a business-to-business marketplace.This required:-The implementation of a new sales call center that saw extended open enrollment deadlines in 2014,-The hiring of additional staff,-Increased direct-to-consumer communication costs to educate consumers about new products and how to access those products, and-The building and implementation of new products, new infrastructure for the continued improvements and changes to the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange and for the implementation of additional mandates for the federal Health Care Reform.Operating expenses - including quality improvement initiatives but excluding federal and state taxes, fees and assessments, and broker commissions - represent 8.7% of premium in small group qualified health plans and 8.4% in individual qualified health plans.VI. REGULATION 146Regulation 146 was a market stabilization mechanism for the individual and small group pools that was in effect prior to the adoption of the ACA. Similar to the ACA Risk Adjustment program, Reg. 146 attempted to equalize the risk within the small group and individual markets by assessing a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and used this revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members. Because of the redundancy with the new risk adjustment program, Reg. 146 is being phased out. The Department of Financial Services is requiring plans to distribute all outstanding compensations through premium adjustments in 2015 and 2016. This distribution plan results in a reduction in the small group qualified health plan premium of 0.3% and in individual premium of about 1%.",Review Complete,12.20,78124NY107,Excellus BCBS HMO,"Excellus Health Plan, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Quarterly,16.44,16.44,RC

The changes in the health insurance market required building and implementing an entirely new sales channel from what had primarily been a business-to-business marketplace.This required:-The implementation of a new sales call center that saw extended open enrollment deadlines in 2014,-The hiring of additional staff,-Increased direct-to-consumer communication costs to educate consumers about new products and how to access those products, and-The building and implementation of new products, new infrastructure for the continued improvements and changes to the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange and for the implementation of additional mandates for the federal Health Care Reform.Operating expenses - including quality improvement initiatives but excluding federal and state taxes, fees and assessments, and broker commissions - represent 8.7% of premium in small group qualified health plans and 8.4% in individual qualified health plans.VI. REGULATION 146Regulation 146 was a market stabilization mechanism for the individual and small group pools that was in effect prior to the adoption of the ACA. Similar to the ACA Risk Adjustment program, Reg. 146 attempted to equalize the risk within the small group and individual markets by assessing a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and used this revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members. Because of the redundancy with the new risk adjustment program, Reg. 146 is being phased out. The Department of Financial Services is requiring plans to distribute all outstanding compensations through premium adjustments in 2015 and 2016. This distribution plan results in a reduction in the small group qualified health plan premium of 0.3% and in individual premium of about 1%.",Review Complete,12.20,78124NY112,Healthy New York,"Excellus Health Plan, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Quarterly,16.87,16.87,RC

The actuarial memorandum describes in detail the development process.  However, upon further questioning, effectively all that was done was trending the 2014 rate filing claims costs forward to 2015.  No adjustments were made for demographics since it was assumed that KHC enrollment would be representative of the entire state.The allowed claims costs were then adjusted for plan design, administration, reinsurance, risk adjustment, and profit / contingencies to calculate the final premium rate per member per month (PMPM).There was an adjustment to reflect a slightly higher risk score for the KHC population relative to the entire state.  Upon questioning, the submitting actuary provided an explanation of the calculation stating they had reviewed available market information to determine statewide risk and compared this to their estimate of KHC risk given enrollment by plan.  The approach, methodology, and assumptions used all appeared to be reasonable.It was unclear in the previous filing how one could move from the premium rates described above the base rates in the rate manual.  Therefore, several questions were asked around this topic.  KHC&rsquo;s certifying actuary was able to demonstrate how one moves from the rates developed in the rate filing to those in the rate manual by using factors reflecting: plan design, tobacco, age, and&ldquo;nonpayment of premium adjustment&rdquo;.  This last factor reflects a slight increase for families with greater than four children.Our review of the rate manual included analyzing the age, tobacco, geographic, and benefit factors.  The age factors followed the federal schedule.  The tobacco factors ranged from 1.00 to 1.20. They were 1.00 for ages less than 21, increased to 1.10 for ages 21-25 and then gradually increased up to 1.20 at age 61.  The benefit factors are based only on the plan&rsquo;s actuarial value, network, and admin costs.KHC&rsquo;s filing included an additional morbidity shift factor of 1.055.

NCDOI&rsquo;s decision on the proposed rate increase was based upon the following:The company corrected an overcharge for the reinsurance assessment.The filing complies with North Carolina laws and regulations, Federal laws, and applicable Actuarial Standards of Practice. The benefits provided are reasonable in relation to the proposed premiums charged.The insurer&rsquo;s assumptions used in projecting costs are reasonable.The insurer&rsquo;s projected experience supports the rate increase proposal.The proposed rate increase is not unreasonable based upon the expected claim payments, administrative expenses, and margin.The threshold rate increase is +11.98%.Premium rates are in compliance with ACA rating rules. The Aetna Gold plan includes induced utilization and Aetna network factor.NCDOI&rsquo;s determination included consideration of the following factors, as applicable:Medical cost trend changesChanges in utilization of services (i.e., hospital care, pharmaceuticals, doctors&rsquo; office visits)Cost-sharing changesChanges in benefitsChanges in enrollee risk profileImpact of over- or under-estimate of medical trend in previous years on the current rateReserve needsAdministrative costs related to programs that improve health care qualityOther administrative costsApplicable taxes and licensing or regulatory fees including ACA fees and assessmentsMedical loss ratioThe insurer&rsquo;s capital and surplus",Not Applicable,"SummaryAetna is filing rates for Small Group plans in North Carolina. This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 11.98%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 104 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 9.8% year over year excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in North Carolina, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&#61623; The cost for an outpatient hospital service has increased 10%.&#61623; The cost for an inpatient hospital admission has increased 5.4%.&#61623; Costs for pharmacy prescriptions are increasing 7% year over year due to the release of Sovaldi for Hepatitis-C patients.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer North Carolina small businesses a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements, as well as to comply with the metal value requirements for small group plan designs. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes increased expected medical costs by an average of 2.5%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&#61623;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing (also known as the Federal Transitional Policy)&#61623; Enhanced network access standards&ndash; which limit our ability to control the cost and quality of medical care&#61623; Changes to required taxes and feesWill Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 11.98%?No, the stated increases are averages. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down. Others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the age and family size for enrolling employees, where in North Carolina the group is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that groups pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Aetna Navigator, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services. Additionally, Aetna&rsquo;s Plan for Your Health website aims to educate all consumers, not just Aetna members, on how to take advantage of their health care benefits.",Review Complete,11.98,61671NC005,Aetna Health Maintenance Organization,Aetna Health Inc.

Below is the revised Part 2 narrative provided by the carrier:&quot;This letter specifically addresses the rate increase requested for PICs individual product which impacts 81,437 members. The rate increase being requested for PICs individual product is 55.5 percent in aggregate. The requested rate increase varies by plan within the product with a minimum increase of 39.1 percent and a maximum increase of 93.6 percent. Please note the initial 2014 proposed rate increase was 85.3 percent and the final implemented rate increase was 17.2 percent.A number of items were considered when developing the premium rates, including but not necessarily limited to changes in the following itemsa. Projected morbidity level of the population anticipated to purchase the plans,b. Anticipated medical trend, both utilization and cost of services,c. Applicable taxes and fees, including those applicable in 2015 under ACA,d. Anticipated risk adjustment payments receipts, ande. Anticipated contributions to the Federal Transitional Reinsurance Program.Premium rates for the individual products were developed using PICs 2013 small group non grandfathered experience adjusted for demographic differences with the individual market, in conjunction with internal research proprietary to Milliman and other industry studies and surveys. One of the biggest driver of the rate change is setting PICs underlying claims morbidity similar to the small group morbidity level. We used PICs small group allowed claims from 2013 as the basis for claim development for the individual product. Based on research and emerging PIC 2014 individual claims data, we are finding that individual exchange populations have health status similar to historical small group books of business. Further, PIC has worked with outside consultants to estimate the risk adjustment payment or receipt due in 2015. Even with the risk adjustments, PIC exhibits experience very similar to small groupAnother driver of the rate change is due to the lower Federal reinsurance recoveries. The recoveries assume in 2015 PIC will receive 50 percent of all PICs individual members per member per year incurred claims between 70,000 and 250,000. In 2014, rates were priced for recoveries to be 80 percent of claims between 60,000 and 250,000.1. FINANCIAL EXPERIENCEPICs financial experience for individual products is displayed in Table 1 below.

In addition, deductible levels have been changed for some plans in order to maintain compliance with metal tier requirements after the application of AV adjustments requested by the MN Department of Commerce, PIC will also be offering one new bronze plan and one new network in 2015.

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED PROFITSPIC targets a federally prescribed medical loss ratio of 88.3 percent for its individual block of business. The loss ratio as calculated in accordance with Minnesota State law which includes taxes and fees is 97.1 percent. This loss ratio allows for total health plan administrative costs and anticipated profits. PICs administrative expenses as a percent of premium decreased roughly 6 percent when compared to the 2014 filing. Anticipated after tax margin increased from negative 2.5 percent in 2014 to .5 percent in 2015.&quot;More comments from state:The revised narrative above points out that the small group morbidity provided a better basis for morbidity than their own individual market experience from 2013 and before. This morbidity basis change is acceptable because 1) adjustments were made by the carrier's actuarial staff and consultants to reflect the demographic and plan design selection differences between the small group and individual market participants, and 2) the carrier's own 2013 (and earlier) individual market experience has been adequately demonstrated to state regulators to have been a poor basis for predicting the claims that this carrier will experience after January 1, 2014. Despite the high increase in last year's rates (17.2%) and the conservative risk adjustment and reinsurance receipts that this carrier had assumed for 2014 rating, this carrier had very competitive rates and has also experienced much anti-selection. All carriers are unsure of how the risk adjustment program will compensate for such anti-selection, since they do not yet know what their statewide competitors have experienced. The unique guarantee renewal rules in MN preclude this carrier from removing plans going forward that have contributed to anti-selection, such as platinum plans.",Not Applicable,"HIOS Part II Preliminary Justification&ndash; Written Explanation of Rate IncreasePreferredOne Insurance CompanyIndividual Product in MinnesotaJanuary 1, 2015 through December 31, 20151.

The State's review was concentrated on compliance of the issuer's rate increase request with Idaho laws and regulations and also included fulfillment of the process for the review of unreasonable rate increases established under Section 2794 of the Public Health Service Act.The health trend for this filing is an assumption of 10.9% annually, which PacificSource has justified with a trend analysis.The remaining increase is due to worse than expected claims costs, which are projected to continue, additional federal fees, and morbidity assumption changes. We reviewed the data and assumptions that PacificSource used in determining this adjustment and found them not unreasonable. The company's projected risk margin upon implementing this increase is 3.0%.With this rate increase, the company expects to pay 79.5% of premium collected as claims.  After allowable adjustments, this meets or exceeds the federal minimum loss ratio requirements of 80%.",Not Applicable,"This filing requests an aggregate increase of 36.9% over the rates approved in our 2014 Idaho Individual filing. The proposed rates are basedon PacificSource's historical Idaho Individual claims experience adjusted for PacificSource's historical average risk and demographics comparedto the market average risk and demographics, expected medical trend, expected change in market morbidity from 2013 (experience period) to2015 (projection period), changes in benefits, and expected state and federal reinsurance recoveries. The proposed rates also reflect changes inthe taxes and fees imposed on health insurers for 2015.The increase in rates from 2014 to 2015 is primarily driven by deteriorating experience, trend, changes in morbidity assumptions, and reducedreinsurance recoveries. PacificSource's Idaho Individual PMPM claims grew by approximately 18% from 2012 to 2013, the experience bases forthe 2014 and 2015 filings, respectively. The combined medical and pharmacy annual trend used in this filing to project claims from 2013 to 2015is 10.9%, which reflects expected changes in costs, changes in utilization, and the impact of leveraging. With access to more current data andusing a revised methodology, the overall increase in morbidity from PacificSource pre&#8208;ACA experience to post&#8208;ACA market experience is greaterthan originally projected in our 2014 filing. At the time 2014 rates were set, the 2014 federal reinsurance parameters were a $60,000 attachmentpoint with 80% coinsurance up to to $250,000. Our requested 2015 rates are based on the parameters outlined in the 2015 Final Benefit andPayment Parameters from the Federal Register. The 2015 parameters are a $70,000 attachment point, 50% coinsurance up to $250,000.Over 2013, the Idaho Individual block earned $29.0 million in premium and incurred an estimated $27.9million in claims, for a medical claims rate of 96.3%. Combined administrative expenses, commissions, taxes, and assessments wereapproximately 24.2% of premium, meaning the total expenses were approximately 120.4% of premium.PacificSource projects that the Idaho Individual block will earn $40.9 million in premium in 2015 and incur approximately $32.5 million in claims,for a medical claims rate of 79.5%.

The Department therefore finds the proposed increase to be not unreasonable.,Not Applicable,"Scope and Range:Highmark Inc. is requesting an average premium increase of 20.8% (ranging from 14.9% to 21.9%) for its 2015 ACA-qualifying small group products with effective dates from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015.The extension of pre-ACA (transitional) policies, as announced by HHS on March 5, 2014, allows most small groups to keep their existing (non-ACA compliant) plans beyond 2015.  Lower cost small groups are expected to remain outside the ACA single-risk pool due to more favorable premium rates afforded to them in the pre-ACA rating formula.  The remaining population expected to enroll in the ACA qualifying products represents a small portion of the pool, and those groups generally have unfavorable demographics and higher than average costs.Historical Financial Experience:The historical experience is for Highmark&rsquo;s subsidiary HHIC.  Highmark Inc. did not have any small group plans available in 2013 and HHIC&rsquo;s experience has been used to price these plans.  This experience is listed below.Three-year financial experience for the HHIC Small Group segment is as follows:2013 Premium $892,423,0002013 Claims $802,561,0002013 Operating Results ($22,664,000)2013 Loss Ratio 89.9%2012 Premium $1,003,072,0002012 Claims $899,818,0002012 Operating Results ($15,687,000)2012 Loss Ratio 89.7%2011 Premium $1,086,460,0002011 Claims $933,662,0002011 Operating Results $34,798,0002011 Loss Ratio 85.9%Change in Medical Service Costs:While the 2013 experience for the non-grandfathered plans rose at a moderate 4.5%, the projected population is expected to add another 20.6% to the cost of medical care per member per month (PMPM).  This is relative to the assumptions used in the 2014 rate filing, which was submitted before the transitional policies were announced and assumed that all small groups would migrate to the ACA pool in 2014.  This is offset slightly by higher allowed demographic factors.Change in Benefits:No benefit changes are being proposed within this filing.Administrative Costs and Anticipated Operating Results:Relative to the 2014 rate filing, internal administrative costs remain essentially flat on a per member per month basis.  The Health Insurer Tax increases in 2015 by another 1.5% of premium.  The total administrative costs are lower, as a percent of premium, due to the higher projected claim costs.The anticipated operating results are not excessive or unreasonable.

Scope and Range of the Rate IncreaseDenver Health Medical Plan, Inc. (DHMP) is increasing premium rates for individual Elevate Basic plans by 18.4% and Elevate Expanded plans by 14.3%. A subscriber&rsquo;s actual rate could be higher or lower depending on the benefit plan selected, age of the subscriber, and dependent coverage. There are 658 members in these products as of May 1, 2014, who are affected by the increase.2.	Financial ExperienceThese products were both introduced in 2014, and so as of the time of this rate request, there is only a limited amount of experience data available. Rates for 2015 continue to be based on external claims data sources from prior to 2014, adjusted for differences in the post-ACA individual insurance market.It typically takes several months to get a complete view of healthcare costs due to delays in receiving medical claims from healthcare providers. Prescription drug claims usually become available much faster. As of April 10, 2014, DHMP has paid approximately $225,000 in prescription drug claims for Elevate members, representing an average monthly claim cost of approximately $257 per member per month (PMPM). This prescription drug claim level is much higher than was expected when 2014 rates were developed. Under the ACA, premiums are set based on the expected health status of the entire market, not of DHMP&rsquo;s own enrollees&ndash; so high costs for DHMP do not directly translate into rate increases.The proposed rate increase is expected to produce a medical loss ratio (MLR) of 83.5%. It should be noted that the projected MLR meets the minimum requirement of 80.0% as defined in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). If the actual MLR were to fall below this level (such as if actual claim costs turn out to be lower than expected), DHMP would pay rebates to members as required by the ACA.3.	Changes in Medical CostsThe primary drivers of the components of the proposed rate increases are associated with higher utilization of inpatient, outpatient, and professional services, and prescription drugs. Healthcare providers and drug makers have, for many years, increased prices faster than the general rate of inflation. This directly affects health insurance premiums. Also, the rate with which services are utilized has also been increasing. This increase is partially offset by more favorable contracts DHMP has negotiated with its provider network.The enrolled population in 2014 is significantly older, on average, than was projected. For example, DHMP enrolled relatively few children, and the adults had a much higher average age than expected. Published data suggest that this was true for many insurers selling coverage on Colorado&rsquo;s exchange. Healthcare costs, on average, increase with age. The ACA does not allow adult premiums to vary by more than a 3-to-1 ratio based on age, even though the variation in costs due to age is wider than 3-to-1. This regulatory requirement to&ldquo;compress&rdquo; premiums across different ages results in higher rates overall when the average age of the population increases, particularly for younger adults.The federal Transitional Reinsurance program provided a significant amount of premium reduction to the individual market in 2014. The ACA specifies that this reduction will decline in 2015 (it will decline in further in 2016 and be eliminated entirely in 2017).4.	Changes in BenefitsBenefits are changing only slightly. As approved by the Colorado Division of Insurance (SERFF tracking number DVHH-129467559), copays for specialty and non-preferred branded prescription drugs will be changing to a deductibleandcoinsurance structure. This change offsets a portion of the rate increase.Because nearly all benefits are remaining the same, and because these benefits include fixed-dollar deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket maximum,&ldquo;leveraging&rdquo; causes premiums to rise faster than claims. This is because member cost sharing becomes a progressively smaller portion of total claims when deductibles, copayments, and out-of-pocket limits do not increase.5.	Administrative Costs and Anticipated Provision for Profit and ContingenciesWe are proposing no change to DHMP&rsquo;s provision for profit and contingencies.There has been no proposed increase in DHMP&rsquo;s allowance for general overhead expense. The only expense assumptions that have changed for 2015 are:&bull;	A slight increase due to higher reinsurance costs (this refers to reinsurance coverage purchased by DHMP, not the ACA&rsquo;s transitional reinsurance program)&bull;	An increase due to higher costs associated with internal personnel and external brokers involved with assisting new members with signing up for coverage",Review Complete,14.57,66699CO004,Elevate (G),"Denver Health Medical Plan, Inc",COLORADO,CO,Annual,14.57,14.57,RC

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 13.1%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 15 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.For Product 83808MS038 the current enrollment is 15. These members will have an approximate rate increase of 13.1%.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 7.7%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer small employers in Mississippi a variety of plans to choose from. Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&#61623;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&#61623; Changes to required taxes and fees&#61623; Changes to Benefit Requirements&#61623; Restrictions on Underwriting practicesWill Premiums for All Small Group Plans Increase 13.1%?No, the 13.1% is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down, others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, the number of members (for family plans) and their ages, where in Mississippi the employer is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of actions to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.",Review Complete,13.13,83808MS040,SHOP HPN Bronze,Coventry Health and Life,MISSISSIPPI,MS,Annual,13.13,13.13,RC

When HHS applied these assumptions, the rate increase was not found to be excessive.",Not Applicable,"SummaryCoventry Health Care of Kansas is filing rates for Small Group plans in Oklahoma. This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 15.8%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Fewer than 10 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included inthis filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 7.5%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer small groups in Oklahoma a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&bull;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&bull; Changes to required taxes and fees&bull; Changes to Benefit Requirements&bull; Restrictions on Underwriting practicesWill Premiums for All Small Group Plans Increase 15.8%?No, the 15.8% is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down, others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, the number of members (for family plans) and their ages, and where in Oklahoma the group is located.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of actions to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&bull; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.",Review Complete,15.76,76668OK006,OK Sm Grp - HMO,"Coventry Health Care of Kansas, Inc.",OKLAHOMA,OK,Annual,15.76,15.76,RC

Actuarial Review Commentsa) ACA ComplianceMetal level:                                    VariousActuarial Value:                             This filing has all PPO plans ranging from HHS calculator results.AV calculation method:                 We reviewed the development of the actuarial values in Worksheet 2 of the URRT and found them to be reasonable and within the CMS specified guidelines.b) Development of Base Period ExperienceThis is a filing that was introduced on January 1, 2014 in response to the ACA mandates.Since, this plan has been in effect for less than a year, the base period data used for projection purpose includes the claims data from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013 with an assumed credibility of 100 percent.During this base period, for the Colorado individual market, this plan has 177,388 covered member months resulting in a 100 percent credibility.The base period claims used in the projection include an appropriate adjustment for IBNR reserves. During the base period, the loss ratio for the combined population was 72.32 percent.c) Development of Trends1) Utilization Adjustment Trend Development and Application:The average increase in the utilization assumed for the projection is 8.0 percent, this varies from a high of 11.9 percent for outpatient services, to a low of 5.0 percent for professional services.2) Unit Cost Adjustment Trend Development and Application:The average increase in the unit cost assumed for the projection is 1.5 percent, this varies from a high of 21.0 percent for other medical services which are only 2 percent of the total claims to a general unit cost increase of 1.5 percent for other services. The increase in the costs for prescription drugs was 3.0 percent.3) Population Morbidity Adjustment Trend Development and Application:Due to the change in the assumed increase in the population risk characteristic, the plan has assumed an additional impact of 19 percent.4) Other Trend Development and Application:The total unit cost and utilization trend used in the projection of the experience was 9.5 percent. This trend assumption is based on the historical three year analysis of the individual claims data. The three year historical average shows a total utilization and unit cost trend of 9.9 percent. Over the past three years, 2009-2012 the trend varied from a high of 12.4 percent in 2012 to a low of 7.3 percent in 2010.The assumed trend rate of 9.5 percent used in the projection of the claims for the year is in line with the historical experience and is well supported. The support for the development of the trend can be found in the file&quot;2015_01_01_Appendix B IM Trend Summary.pdf&quot;There is an adjustment of 3.5% within the pricing and claim projection to include new and expanded benefits in accordance with the EHB requirements of the ACA. These expanded benefits include: Mental Health and Substance Abuse resulting in a 1.2 percent increase, Pediatric Vision resulting in a 0.4 percent increase, Private Duty Nursing resulting in 0.3 percent increase and Pediatric Dental resulting in a 1.6 percent increase.  The Pediatric Dental expense was estimated using commercial group experience for 2011 and 2012 from the Assurant Employee Benefits segment. The remaining estimates were based upon purchased data of experience of a standard population.To account for the coverage of additional preventative items that will be paid on a first dollar due to updates by the USPSTF, Assurant Health has used a trend rate of 1.0 percent. This estimate was determined by evaluating the volume of these items in the historical experience. The additional first dollar preventative benefits that will be included in 2015 are:1.) Alcohol Misuse2.) Breast Cancer Risk3.) Hepatitis C Screening4.) HIV Screening5.) Tobacco Use Prevention in Children and Adolescentsd) Development of Non Benefit ExpensesThe non-benefit expenses used in the development of the projected rates include: Administrative and overhead expenses of 12.0 percentManaged Care and Cost Containment expense of 2.5 percentCommissions of 5.0 percentQuality Improvement expense of 0.9 percentPremium Tax of 2.0 percentColorado Exchange Fee of 0.53 percentFederal Taxes (FICA, FUTA) of 0.94 percentACA Health insurer fee expense of 1.7 percentFederal Taxes were assumed at 3.0 percentThe plan assumed a net income of -2.5 percent.The non-benefit expenses for this plan are towards the higher end of the range. This is primarily due to general administrative expenses being towards the higher end of the range. The assumption was derived from actual expenses in 2013 relative to actual revenue. In developing this expense assumption, underwriting expenses were adjusted due to the reduction of staff within the underwriting functional area that occurred in response to the 2014 market rules.Manage care cost containment expense is a variable expense that accounts for expenses incurred in order to reduce claims costs, such as access fees paid to the Preferred Provider Organization Networks that are leased on behalf of the customers. This expense assumption was derived from actual expenses in 2013 relative to actual revenue.e) Development of Profit/Contingencies MarginFor Assurant health, the target profit margin is 6 percent pretax or 3 percent post tax. For this filing for 2015, the assumed profit margin is 4.4 percent pretax resulting in a 2 percent after tax margin. The assumed profit margin for this plan is well within the normal range for plans of this size and nature.f) Development of Projected Loss RatiosTo develop the projected loss ratios, earned premium and incurred claims from the experience period were projected forward to the rating period.Premiums were adjusted for member persistency and for historical&ndash; and previously scheduled&ndash; rate changes between the start of the experience period and the start of the rating period. The member persistency rate is based on the historical change in enrollment.In general, the assumptions and methods used to develop the projected loss ratios are reasonable.g) How the Rate Increase was developedThe projected loss ratio without the requested rate increase was 97.9 percent.  The plan would need a rate increase of 35.0 percent in order to achieve a projected loss ratio of 72.5 percent which when adjusted for federal level is slightly above the targeted loss ratio of 80 percent.The rate increase of 35 percent can be split into the following components:General Utilization and Unit Cost Trend of 9.5 PercentMorbidity Assumption Change Impact of 19.0 PercentInclusion of Preventive Benefits of 1.0 PercentBenefits Leveraging of 3.0 PercentMiscellaneous including increase in non-benefit expense, reinsurance etc. of 2.5 percent.h) Further Support for Large Rate IncreaseThe large increase requested by the plan is primarily due to the change in the underlying morbidity assumption.  The 2014 morbidity assumption was 30% and the 2015 morbidity assumption is 55%, which results in a 19% increase (1.55/1.30&ndash; 1). The actuaries provided the analysis of the first six months of 2014 data and the emerging experience shows an average of 65% morbidity assumption. The morbidity assumption used in the pricing of 55% is lower than the one suggested by the experience.The emerging experience for the first six months shows a loss ratio for this product and population to be 167 percent further suggesting a large rate increase.i) Consumer CommentsThe Division received consumer comments on this filing and considered these comments in its review of the filing, to the extent appropriate. The Division may have had access to confidential information that the consumer did not. We have taken these consumer comments into account during the actuarial review and determined that the material in this filing is documented and justified.j) Reviewer SignoffSigned by:     Nicholas Crifasik) Contractor SignoffSigned by:     Sanjit Puri ASA MAAABased on the analysis and supporting documentation we recommend approval for the requested rate increase.",Not Applicable,"This is a Time Insurance Company rate filing for existing form TIM14.POL.CO and new form TIM14.15.POL.CO.These are non-grandfathered Individual Major Medical products which cover the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) as required under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The development of the rates for these plans is detailed in the Part III Actuarial Memorandum.2014 premium and claims experience for these products is not yet complete.The requested average rate increase is 35%.  The range of rate increase is 21% - 60%, not including attained age.  There are 5,662 covered individuals who will be impacted by this rate increase in Colorado.  The rate increase will be effective January 1, 2015.The rate increase was developed based on the pricing methodology prescribed by the ACA.This rate increase is needed because allowed medical trend is assumed to continue at an annual rate of 9.5%.  This includes increases in both the price and utilization of medical services.  In addition, there are new fees associated with the ACA which contributed to the rate increase. The increase is also caused by a decrease in reinsurance recoveries provided by the ACA reinsurance program.The loss ratio is the ratio of incurred claims to earned premium.

633054,38344,Individual,ST,01/01/2015,true,06/13/2014,09/15/2014,Not Unreasonable,"Alaska reviewed Premera&rsquo;s rate filing for compliance with AS 21.51.405, 3 AAC 31.235 and rate requirements in 45 CFR Part 154.  Alaska&rsquo;s general standard of review is that rates may not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory (i.e. not unreasonable). Premera provided the information and analysis as specifically required under 3 AAC 31.235 and other information requested during the course of the review including detailed 2014 emerging experience.The Division reviewed the data and information provided by Premera in support of the requested rate increase including but not limited to historical and projected claims, premiums, expenses, health care cost and utilization experience, as well as the method and rating factors that determined  the rate increase.  Based on this review the Division concluded that the average 37.2 percent rate increase was justified and not unreasonable.  The requested rate increase was projected to be significantly less than needed in order to cover the projected cost of claims and expenses in Alaska in 2015 and in determining whether the requested rate increase was in compliance with federal and state rating laws, the Division did consider Premera&rsquo;s financial stability and strength to assure that it was sufficient to make good on its obligation to pay claims.Premera projects that their loss ratio for the individual insurance business will significantly exceed the federal minimum loss ratio of 80 percent and therefore anticipates no rebates will be paid.The rate changes will become effective on 1/1/2015.",Not Applicable,"Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield HHS Form Part IIProduct effective date January 1st 2015Individual Metallic ProductsPremera Blue Cross Blue Shield (Premera) is filing this rate change request to cover the annual cost increases which apply to our individual metallic products both in and out of the exchange in Alaska.Members affected by this filingPremera currently has 6,923 members on metallic plans. 5,013 of those members enrolled through the Healthcare.gov, the federal marketplace. The remaining 1,910 enrolled directly with Premera.Plan design and benefitsThese plans are designed to meet the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirements for actuarial value and Essential Health Benefits.  For 2015 we have added in network pediatric dental class 1 services to be covered in full on our gold plans.Rates and changes in costsWe are extremely concerned about the costs we are currently seeing in the Alaska market and the implications of these costs for the long term sustainability of individual healthcare coverage across the state.The implementation of the ACA has transformed the Alaska individual market. The combination of guaranteed access to coverage, the extension of non ACA compliant plans under transitional relief rules and a state with a comparatively small number of individual consumers may not be sustainable as currently structured.  Although the ACA includes some risk mitigation programs (reinsurance, risk adjustment and risk corridors) these are insufficient in a state that lacks an individual market which is large or stable enough to spread risk.The risk experience in the metallic plan risk pool is further influenced by the fact that 50 percent of the state&rsquo;s high risk pool (ACHIA) and 100 percent of the federal Preexisting Condition Insurance Pool have left those plans and have likely now purchased coverage in the individual market.  Premera may have obtained a disproportionate share of these individuals.Premera is committed to working with the Division of Insurance (DOI), the State, and the industry to develop and implement programs that will help to stabilize the market and keep costs affordable for individual consumers.   As a result, our 2015 rate filing is significantly lower than is needed to break even for our metallic lines of business. Programs such as a supplemental state re insurance program will spread high medical costs across the insured market and limit the need for large rate increases in the individual market in the future.For 2015 a 72.3 percent would be required for this line of business to break even. However, Premera is filing for an average rate increase of 37.2 percent across our individual metallic plans both on and off the exchange.  Based on this filing, rate increases could range from 35.2 percent to 40.2 percent.Key drivers of ratesThese rates are driven by two key factors:The extremely high claims costs that are being incurred by members on our metallic plans.The size and composition of the pool across which these claims costs are being spread.Claims costsBased on data from the first quarter of 2014, our claims costs per member, per month are running at $878, well over the $195 we spent per member, per month in 2013Just 15 new members have incurred $3.8 million between January 1st and April 30th in 2014.Pool size and compositionPrior to open enrollment we had anticipated that approximately 15,000 consumers would enroll in metallic plans. However, most likely as a result of problems with Healthcare.gov and the extension of nonmetallic plans under transitional relief, only 6,000 consumers enrolled.The demographic composition of those that did enroll in metallic plans was older and less healthy than anticipated.Just to break even, given the claims experience we are currently seeing, would require a 72.3 percent rate increase for our individual metallic plans for 2015. This rate increase breaks down as detailed below:Health condition of new enrollees, including from state and federal high risk pools: 56.68 percentReduction of federal re insurance: 7.8 percentIncrease in federal tax on insured health plans: 2.2 percentRemaining factors: 6.2 percent, specifically,4.7 percent for overall rising medical costs1.5 percent for additional fees and administrative costsWe do not want to pass on such a significant rate increase to our individual market consumers in Alaska.  As such we are filing for a 37.2 percent average rate increase for 2015, which includes a projected loss of $5 million for Premera.Expected use of the rate dollarPremera is committed to using our members&rsquo; rate dollar responsibly and consistently pays out a high percentage of the members&rsquo; rate dollar on medical claims. Given the current claims experience for this line of business and our projected losses in 2015, we expect to pay over 100percent of our members&rsquo; premium dollars toward medical claims for 2015, thus incurring a loss on this line of business. In addition to medical claims, the following costs will also be incurred:ACA related taxes and fees, including fees paid toward Healthcare.gov, account for 6.9percent of the rate dollar in 2015.Premera continues to focus on increasing efficiency and reducing our administrative expenses. These costs are expected to account for 6percent of the rate dollar in 2015.Commission to producers brokers is expected to account for 3percent of members&rsquo; premium dollar in 2015Financial experience of the product:2014 is the first year of experience for these products. Based on data through April 2014, Premera currently projects a $3.6 million loss serving individual market customers on metallic plans in 2014 without commercial reinsurance.Our estimates show that without a rate increase for 2015, these losses could increase to $37 million in 2015, based on a market of 12,000 members. This equates to a loss of approximately $250 per member, per month.",Review Complete,36.83,38344AK057,Multi-State Plan Plus HSA HIGH,Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska,ALASKA,AK,Annual,36.83,36.83,RC

The projected 2015 plan year medical loss ratio after the proposed rate increases is 82.4 percent.The choice of assumptions and the combination of assumptions upon which the rate increase is based are reasonable.  When HHS applied these assumptions, the rate increase was not found to be excessive.",Not Applicable,"GENERAL INFORMATIONCigna is filing rates for Individual plans in Texas effective January 2015 through December 2015.  The proposed rate increases exceed the subject to review threshold in 45 CFR 154.200. In accordance with the requirements in 45 CFR 154.215 this document describes the justification for the increase in the rates.SIGNIFICANT FACTORSThe most significant factors requiring the rate increase are:Claim Cost Trend: The increasing cost of medical services accounts for the majority of the premium rate increases.  We anticipate that the cost of medical services (reflecting unit cost and utilization) in 2015 will increase over the 2014 level.Morbidity (Risk Pool) Adjustments: The marketplace for non-grandfathered individual plans is affected by changes brought about by provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act) that became effective in 2014, including:guarantee issue and renewal requirementsmodified community- rating requirementfederal premium subsidies for low and moderate income individuals.The effects of these 2014 changes when coupled with previous regulatory changes (e.g., transitional policy allowances) and early indications of utilization thus far in 2014 suggest that it is appropriate to increase the overall claim level assumption reflected in the premiums for individual plans in Texas.EXPERIENCE&amp; PROJECTIONSNon-grandfathered individual plans subject to the changes brought about by Affordable Care Act have only been effective since January 1, 2014. As a result, our claim experience with respect to these individual plans at the time of this filing is immature.  Cigna expects, however, that loss ratios for its individual plans in Texas will be in excess of the federally defined minimum loss ratio threshold of 80% in 2014.  Even with the proposed 2015 rate increase, we expect that the loss ratios for our individual plans to exceed the federally defined minimum loss ratio threshold of 80%, thereby ensuring that the amount of premium spent on claims and quality improvement activities is more than required by the Affordable Care Act.Cigna's COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE WE SERVECigna&rsquo;s view is that the objectives of improved health, quality and cost with a focus on the individual are all closely aligned with the company&rsquo;s mission and strategy for a sustainable and affordable healthcare system. Cigna&rsquo;s entry in this market reflects its principles and Cigna&rsquo;s plans are designed to help individualsNavigate the complex world of healthcare to access the best and most cost-effective care.Find the right family doctor from top-rated local networks which are increasingly aligned to innovative partnerships centered around the highest-performing, value-based physician networksCigna&rsquo;s nurses, service people and information are there when customers need it 24-7-365 via phone, online, and Cigna's new consumer apps.These capabilities are available to all of Cigna&rsquo;s 14 million-plus US customers: from the Fortune 500 CEO to the individual purchasing a health plan for the first time on their local public marketplace exchange.In the individual and family plan market, Cigna is making a dedicated effort to outreach and engage its customers starting with a robust onboarding program.

The proposed  rate increases exceed the subject to review threshold in 45 CFR 154.200. In accordance with the requirements in 45 CFR 154.215 this document describes the justification for the increase in the rates.SIGNIFICANT FACTORSThe most significant factors requiring the rate increase areClaim Cost Trend: The increasing cost of medical services accounts for the majority of the premium rate increases.  We anticipate that the cost of medical services (reflecting unit cost and utilization) in 2015 will increase over the 2014 level.Transitional Reinsurance Program Changes: The federally mandated transitional reinsurance program is in effect for three years (2104, 2015, and 2016). The amount of funding available to issuers under the reinsurance program to offset adverse claim experience decreases each year ($10B in 2014, $6B in 2015, and $4B in 2016).  Additional premium is required to compensate for the reduced reinsurance support in 2015.Morbidity (Risk Pool) Adjustments: The marketplace for non-grandfathered individual plans is affected by changes brought about by provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act) that became effective in 2014, including:guarantee issue and renewal  requirementsmodified community- rating requirementfederal premium subsidies for low and moderate income individuals.The effects of these 2014 changes when coupled with previous regulatory changes (e.g., transitional policy allowances) and early indications of utilization thus far in 2014 suggest that it is appropriate to increase the overall claim level assumption reflected in the premiums for individual plans in South Carolina.EXPERIENCE AND PROJECTIONSNon-grandfathered individual plans subject to the changes brought about by Affordable Care Act have only been effective since January 1, 2014. As a result, our claim experience with respect to these individual plans at the time of this filing is immature.  Cigna expects, however, that loss ratios for its individual plans in South Carolina will be in excess of the federally defined minimum loss ratio threshold of 80% in 2014.  Even with the proposed 2015 rate increase, we expect that the loss ratios for our individual plans to exceed the federally defined minimum loss ratio threshold of 80%, thereby ensuring that the amount of premium spent on claims and quality improvement activities is more than required by the Affordable Care Act.Cigna's COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE WE SERVECigna&rsquo;s view is that the objectives of improved health, quality and cost with a focus on the individual are all closely aligned with the company&rsquo;s mission and strategy for a sustainable and affordable healthcare system. Cigna&rsquo;s entry in this market reflects its principles, and Cigna&rsquo;s plans are designed to help individuals:Navigate the complex world of healthcare to access the best and most cost-effective care.Find the right family doctor from top-rated local networks which are increasingly aligned to innovative partnerships centered around the highest-performing, value-based physician networksCigna&rsquo;s nurses, service people and information are there when customers need it 24-7-365 via phone, online, and Cigna's new consumer apps.These capabilities are available to all of Cigna&rsquo;s 14 million-plus US customers: from the Fortune 500 CEO to the individual purchasing a health plan for the first time on their local public marketplace exchange.In the individual and family plan market, Cigna is making a dedicated effort to outreach and engage its customers starting with a robust onboarding program.

Additionally, simple services can be replaced with more complex services over time, which is known as mix intensity trend. As an example, a relatively low-cost X-ray may be replaced by a relatively high-cost MRI scan. Replacing a service with a more intense service causes the total cost of medical services to increase.",Review Complete,14.80,28162OH009,AultCare Small Group,AultCare Insurance Company,OHIO,OH,Annual,14.80,14.80,RC

(Health Net) filed a Threshold Rate Increase with AZDOI via SERFF tracking number HNAZ-129553495.  Health Net requested an overall increase of 17.7 percent (with minimum impact of 17.5 percent, and maximum impact of 19 percent).  The requested increase affects Health Net's small group HMO major medical health insurance products offered on and off exchange, effective January 1, 2015.  (This Threshold Rate Increase filing corresponds to the Form filing found under SERFF tracking number HNAZ-129553403.)AZDOI requested that its consulting threshold rate review actuaries, Gabriel Roeder Smith&amp; Company (GRS), perform actuarial analysis of the filing and proposed rates.  GRS reviewed the requested increase under the requirements of 45 CFR Part 154.  GRS found Health Net's requested increase of 17.7 percent to be reasonable in relation to the benefits provided.Thus, AZDOI determined that this rate increase is reasonable under 45 CFR Part 154.

With a credibility adjustment, the loss ratio is 88.7%Review of supporting documentation was completed by the Department and verified by independent actuaries.  According, we believe the final rates are not unreasonable and based on actuarial principles.",Not Applicable,"GENERAL INFORMATIONCigna is filing rates for Individual plans in Georgia effective January 2015 through December 2015.  The proposed rate increases exceed the subject to review threshold in 45 CFR 154.200. In accordance with the requirements in 45 CFR 154.215 this document describes the justification for the increase in the rates.SIGNIFICANT FACTORSThe most significant factors requiring the rate increase are:Claim Cost Trend: The increasing cost of medical services accounts for the majority of the premium rate increases.  We anticipate that the cost of medical services (reflecting unit cost and utilization) in 2015 will increase over the 2014 level.Morbidity (Risk Pool) Adjustments: The marketplace for non-grandfathered individual plans is affected by changes brought about by provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act) that became effective in 2014, including:-	Guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal  requirements-	Modified community rating requirements-	Federal premium subsidies for low and moderate income individuals.The effects of these 2014 changes and early indications of utilization thus far in 2014 suggest that it is appropriate to increase the overall claim level assumption reflected in the premiums for individual plans in GeorgiaEXPERIENCE&amp; PROJECTIONSNon-grandfathered individual plans subject to the changes brought about by Affordable Care Act have only been effective since January 1, 2014. As a result, our claim experience with respect to these individual plans at the time of this filing is immature.  Cigna expects, however, that loss ratios for its individual plans in Georgia will be in excess of the federally defined minimum loss ratio threshold of 80% in 2014.  Even with the proposed 2015 rate increase, we expect that the loss ratios for our individual plans to exceed the federally defined minimum loss ratio threshold of 80%, thereby ensuring that the amount of premium spent on claims and quality improvement activities is more than required by the Affordable Care Act.Cigna's COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE WE SERVECigna&rsquo;s view is that the objectives of improved health, quality and cost with a focus on the individual are all closely aligned with the company&rsquo;s mission and strategy for a sustainable and affordable healthcare system. Cigna&rsquo;s entry in this market reflects its principles, and Cigna&rsquo;s plans are designed to help individuals:-	Navigate the complex world of healthcare to access the best and most cost-effective care.-	Find the right family doctor from top-rated local networks which are increasingly aligned to innovative partnerships centered around the highest-performing, value-based physician networks-	Cigna&rsquo;s nurses, service people and information are there when customers need it 24-7-365 via phone, online, and Cigna's new consumer mobile device applications.These capabilities are available to all of Cigna&rsquo;s 14 million-plus US customers: from the Fortune 500 CEO to the individual purchasing a health plan for the first time on their local public marketplace exchange.In the individual and family plan market, Cigna is making a dedicated effort to outreach and engage its customers starting with a robust onboarding program.  For example, through this outreach Cigna is increasingly helping more people find quality care providers who are both cost efficient while using evidence based medicine best practices. Cigna will help those who require prescription medications to identify generic equivalent medications to save them hundreds of dollars annually.  And for those who may have a chronic illness, Cigna puts them in touch with its medical management nurses to help them navigate the system for better, healthier, outcomes.",Review Complete,14.95,50491GA001,GA_IND_Open Access Plus,Cigna Health and Life Insurance Company,GEORGIA,GA,Annual,14.95,14.95,RC

The Commissioner&rsquo;s rate decisions must be based on statistical analysis and reasonable assumptions.  To assist the Commissioner in making these decisions, Maryland Insurance Administration (&ldquo;MIA&rdquo;) actuaries examine the data, methods and assumptions used by each insurer, non-profit health service plan, or HMO (&ldquo;carrier&rdquo;).  They review numerous factors related to proposed premium rates, including the carrier&rsquo;s actual and projected claims experience, medical and prescription costs, administrative costs, and profits or losses.  The Commissioner also considers the impact premium rates will have on Maryland consumers.  Under the federal Affordable Care Act and Maryland law, in the individual and small group markets, 80 cents of every premium dollar must be spent on paying claims or on quality improvement activities that figure increases to 85 cents in the large group market.  If an insurance carrier does not meet these targets, the carrier must pay rebates to policyholders.Modifications to Requested Premium Rates and Basis of ModificationsGroup Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc. submitted a rate filing on May 1, 2014, requesting an average rate increase of 38.1%.  On May 23, 2014, the Company amended its filing to request an average rate increase of 30.2%.  The amended rate filing reflected certain minor adjustments in response to MIA objections, such as modifying its assumptions about projected average age and the projected cost and utilization of dental benefits.  The most significant change, however, was a reduction in the Company&rsquo;s projections about the morbidity of its 2015 individual market enrollees as compared with the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  Specifically, in its amended filing, the Company assigned to its projected 2015 individual market enrollees a morbidity factor that was 1.60 times the morbidity of its 2013 individual market enrollees.  In its May 1, 2014 filing, the Company had assumed a morbidity factor of 1.75.  The MIA proceeded to review the amended May 23, 2014 filing.The MIA concluded that certain of the Company&rsquo;s data, methods, and assumptions were not well supported, including certain assumptions about the projected morbidity of its individual product enrollees in 2015.  In particular, the Company had not adequately supported its assumptions regarding the number of small group enrollees projected to migrate to its individual products, or its assumptions about the morbidity levels of previously uninsured enrollees.  The MIA further concluded that the Company&rsquo;s actual experience during the first half of 2014, as well as other considerations relating to actual and projected enrollment in the 2014 and 2015 individual market, did not support a 1.60 morbidity factor.  The Commissioner also concluded that the requested average premium rate increase of 30.2% would have an abrupt, substantial, and adverse impact on the approximately 12,714 Marylanders currently enrolled in Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s Affordable Care Act-compliant plans in the individual market, and would introduce a high level of volatility into Maryland&rsquo;s individual health insurance market.The MIA prescribed a morbidity factor of 1.40, rather than the Company&rsquo;s requested morbidity factor of 1.60.  This modification resulted in an approximately 10.6% reduction in the Company&rsquo;s proposed premium rates for 2015.As modified during the rate review process, Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc.&rsquo;s premium rates for 2015 reflect an approximately 16.2% increase as compared with its premium rates for 2014.&emsp;DeterminationPursuant to&sect; 11-603(c)(2) of the Insurance Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, the Commissioner has determined that the Company&rsquo;s premium rates,  as modified during the rate review process, are not inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive in relation to benefits.Rate Review Standards and ConsiderationsThe Insurance Commissioner approves health insurance rates in Maryland.

The rates set forth in this filing were calculated as directed in the MIA Order, and CareFirst believes that they are inadequate.Accordingly, while the rates in this submission are filed as directed by the MIA Order and based upon the prescribed morbidity factor of 1.40, the information contained in this Actuarial Memorandum reflects a morbidity factor of 1.60.1.	SCOPE AND RANGE OF THE RATE INCREASE: CF is proposing to raise annual premiums by 16.2%, prior to age band changes. (For CFI the proposed renewal is 11.9%.) The range is 13.6% to 20.1%. (For renewing customers, an age band change adds 2.6% to the renewal, on average, with a range of 0.0% to 4.7% for ages 22 and upwards per the CMS age curve.)The primary factors driving this proposed change in premium rates area)	Projected significant increase in membership volumes with average morbidities higher than 2014.b)	Migration in the pool of former enrollees in Maryland&rsquo;s high risk pool the Maryland Health Insurance Plan (MHIP).c)	An aging of the pool of members.d)	An increase in the cost of medical care delivery in the form of claims trend driven by increases in both unit cost and utilization.e)	An increase in the health insurer fee.2.	FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE OF THE PRODUCT: The incurred period is 1-1-13 through 12-31-13. Total premiums and allowed claims for the period were $27,514,930 and $32,329,729, respectively.A.	Changes in the Morbidity of the Population Insured: CareFirst calculated its proposed rates based upon a morbidity factor of 1.60 however, the rates in this filing are calculated based upon a morbidity factor of 1.40 as ordered by the MIA Order.  CareFirst estimates a morbidity risk factor of 1.60 for 2015 as relayed through the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filings (SERFF) on 5-23-14. Our 1.60 factor was computed after consideration for the morbidity risk factor that was included in the 2014 filed and approved rates.  The morbidity risk factor projections are based upon the model that supported CareFirst&rsquo;s 2014 rate filings.  The model compares known and estimated allowed claims costs per member per month (pmpm) for 2013 to project the cost of various categories of the estimated 2015 membership.  These categories are based upon the prior status of the 2015 membership&ndash; previous CareFirst members (medically underwritten under 65 Individuals, MHIP, Group) and New Entrants sorted by income (less than 200% FPL, greater than 200% FPL).  The risk factor for each category is expressed in terms of allowed claims pmpm cost, and is calculated by comparing the category pmpm claims cost to the 2013 CareFirst Individual membership pmpm cost.  More than 50% of the projected 2015 membership is included in categories supported by actual claims data supporting the previous CareFirst member categories.  The New Entrants&rsquo; categories use projected risk scores based upon a Hilltop study (Basic Health Plan) for the members less than 200% FPL and the Group factor for the greater than 200% FPL members. The Group factor is based upon the almost 250 thousand CareFirst Small Group members that have for decades been community rated and guaranteed issue as is now required under ACA for Individual enrollees. CareFirst&rsquo;s judgment is that this extremely large community rated, guaranteed issue small group pool of members is most representative of the New Entrants greater than 200% FPL.B.	Changes in Demographics: Comparing the overall CareFirst member-level average age as of        12-31-12 to 3-31-14, the average age has increased by 4.5 years from 34.0 to 38.5. Age factors will account for a portion of the corresponding increase in claims cost. We find the CMS age curve spread of 3 to 1 to be lower than the 4.5 to 1 that is more correlated with expected claims costs. We have therefore adjusted expected claims costs accordingly in the experience period (EP) index rate projection in the other category.C.	Trend Factors (Cost-Utilization): The proposed trend of 6.5% is a reduction of 270 basis points from 2014&rsquo;s 9.2%. The improvement is concentrated in outpatient hospital and prescription drug services which comprise 37% of total allowed claims.D.	Projected Loss Ratio: Our projected NAIC DICR for MLR purposes is 83.5%, above the 80.0% minimum of Public Health Service Act (PHSA) 218.3.	CHANGES IN MEDICAL SERVICE COSTS: The experience period index rate is a key component driving the renewal. Last year&rsquo;s implicit 2013 index rate was $222 ($203 x trend of 9.2%). The actual for 2013 is $213 for a favorable variance of -4%.4.	CHANGES IN BENEFITS: For CareFirst&rsquo;s Individual offerings in Maryland, our portfolio is not changing. We will still offer 15 benefit plans&ndash; 1 Young Adult-Catastrophic, 4 Bronze, 4 Silver, 4 Gold and 2 Platinum. We have recalculated the costs of&ldquo;Essential Health Benefits&rdquo; (EHB) as well as Non-EHBs.a)	Per COMAR 31.10.39 Utilization Review of Treatment for Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders, Bulletin 14-07 and due to the passage of SB 759-HB 783, Coverage for Autism Spectrum Disorders, we have calculated an increase in claims of $3 per member per month (PMPM) for 2015. This is largely for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) treatments and is a state-mandated EHB benefit. The $3 PMPM is derived from an incidence assumption of 1 in 68 children ages 1-19, an uptake rate of 1 in 3 and an intensity rate of $40,000 to $95,000 per year depending on age.b)	Other adjustments were made for pediatric dental, mandatory generics, a new hepatitis C prescription drug, Sovaldi, and maternity.c)	Other Adjustments: CareFirst (CF) is proposing to introduce an incentive program (IP) whereby members can earn medical expense debit cards of as much as $250 annually, for an individual ($650 for a family). The cards must be utilized for qualified medical expenses such as deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket costs. The scope includes all benefit plans within CF&rsquo;s portfolio, On and Off the Exchange. This is being done in a revenue-neutral way. That is, the cost to CF of the incentive payments was chosen such that they match the expected savings to CF from more efficacious health care delivery. HealthyBlue (HB) was first launched effective 10-1-10 with the objective of motivating and rewarding greater engagement by the member in his or her health, improved wellness and prevention and better provider coordination and quality. As we sought to respond to feedback about HB, subsequent versions were released on 1-1-12 and 10-1-12. This IP represents an evolution of the HB concept. Further, it joins the tenets of HB with our Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) program which was launched on January, 2011.Our aim is that this IP will improve our members&rsquo; health.d)	Included are decreases to claims costs for a change in our Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) in 2014.e)	Membership Projections: We had projected 58% of enrollment in HMO-based plans as of 12-31-14 in our 2014 filings. Actual data as of 4-10-14 indicates that HMO comprises 69% of our CFI members. We had also expected 5% of enrollment in Platinum plans versus actuals of 13%. We incorporated both of these facts in projecting 12-31-15 enrollment.f)	    For the Young Adult-Catastrophic plan, the deductible-out-of-pocket maximum has been raised from $6,350 to $6,600 per year.g)	Also, per HB 0625, oral chemotherapy coverage has been mandated. The cost of reducing cost shares to not exceed those of intravenous chemotherapy has been deemed negligible.h)	Diabetic supplies have been moved to $0 copays. The deductible applies for H.S.A. plans but not for non-H.S.A.s with negligible price impact.i)	    Retail Clinics such as urgent care centers will have reduced copays to match the PCP rather than specialist copay with negligible price impact.j)	    A 5-tiered structure (Generics-Preferred, Generics-Non-Preferred, Brand Name-Preferred, Brand Name-Non-Preferred, Specialty) is currently used for approximately 20% of our benefits. This is changing to 4-tier structure by collapsing the Generics tiers.5.	ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ANTICIPATED CONTRIBUTION TO RESERVE: The 2015 desired incurred claims ratio (DICR) is 79.3%.A.

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 22.3%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 4,000 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply.  Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal.  Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase.  We expect medical costs to go up 11.9%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below.  Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in New York, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&bull;	The cost for an inpatient hospital admission has increased 7.3%.&bull;	Expenses for emergency treatment have increased 14.8%.&bull;	Expenses related to Physician services have gone up 7.4%.&bull;	Outpatient mental health costs have gone up 7.9%.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsSeveral requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates.  These include:&bull;	Enhanced network access standards&ndash; which limit our ability to control the cost and quality of medical care&bull;	Changes to required taxes and feesWill Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 22.3%?No, the 22.3% is an average.  Some premiums will increase by less or even go down.  Others will increase by more than the average.  The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the family size for enrolling employees, and where in New York the group is located.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care.  These actions include:&bull;	Developing new agreements, arrangements, and  partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull;	Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Aetna Navigator, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services. Additionally, Aetna&rsquo;s Plan for Your Health website aims to educate all consumers, not just Aetna members, on how to take advantage of their health care benefits.",Review Complete,7.98,50138NY011,Healthy New York,Aetna Health Inc.

HIC anticipates that 61% of its policies will be sold On Exchange.In support of their request, HIC has provided premium rates, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template, a Part II Written Explanation of The Rate Increase, and a Part III Actuarial Memorandum. The actuarial memorandum included, inter alia, actuarial assumptions, anticipated loss ratios, other information required by the ACA and appropriate actuarial certifications.INS has reviewed the submission in its entirety. However, INS has given special consideration in its review to the details of the Company&rsquo;s Part III Actuarial Memorandum, the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template and the characteristics of the rating elements subject to the Federal regulations prescribed in 45CFR Part 147 paragraph 147.102.  Based on that review, INS has come to the following key conclusions:URRT Section 1 Experience Period Data&bull;	Earned premiums, incurred claims, allowed claims and index rate per member per month (PMPM) for the experience period, January 2013 through December 2013, appear lower than average&bull;	The completion method used to determine estimated incurred claims and allowed claims is consistent with accepted actuarial methods&bull;	HIC anticipates paying $938,596 in MRL rebates, based on its 2013 experience&bull;	Member months for the Experience Period, 148,154, is expected to decrease slightly to 126,174 for the Projection Period.URRT Section II Allowed Claims, PMPM Basis&bull;	Benefit Category descriptions closely follow the preferred descriptions of the URRT instructions&bull;	The utilization per 1,000 and the average cost/service factors by benefit category for the Experience Period appear to be  lower than average for the Individual market&bull;	The total allowed PMPM claim cost of $180.14 (Section II) matches the index rate of $180.00 (Section I) for the experience period (difference due to rounding)&bull;	The overall annual Trend assumption of 6.5%, projected for two years, appears to be reasonable.&bull;	HIC used a&lsquo;Population Risk Morbidity&rsquo; factor of 1.84 to project their underlying experience. The expected increase in morbidity is due to:1.	The inability to underwrite new entrants2.	Adverse Selection3.	Changes in the expected plan mixBased on the narrative and chart provided by the company, INS believes the 1.84 Morbidity factor to be reasonable&bull;	The&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factor used by HIC to project their underlying experience was set to 1.101. The main drivers behind this factor were:1.	Induced utilization2.	Additional benefits to meet the Essential Health Benefit (EHB) guidelines3.	Demographic changes4.	Changes in the geographic distribution of the membershipBased on the narrative and chart provided by the company, INS believes the 1.101&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factor to be reasonable.URRT Section II Credibility Manual&bull;	The basis of HIC&rsquo;s Credibility Manual is the company&rsquo;s own nationwide Individual health experience for 2013&bull;	The trend assumption used for the Credibility Manual, 6.5%, was the same assumption used for projecting the experience data&bull;	The&lsquo;Population Risk Morbidity&rsquo; and&lsquo;Other&rsquo; factors used for the Credibility Manual were fine-tuned slightly from those used to project the experience data in order to  adjust for using nationwide data&bull;	 Based on the narrative provided by the company, the development of the Credibility Manual appears reasonable.URRT Section III Projected Experience&bull;	HIC&rsquo;s&lsquo;Projected Allowed Experience Claims PMPM&rsquo; is based 64.5% on its projected actual experience and 35.5% on its Credibility Manual.  The method used to determine the credibility of the Experience Period data appears to be actuarially reasonable&bull;	The method used to determine the&lsquo;Paid to Allowed Average Factor in the Projection Period&rsquo; of 79.5% is actuarially acceptable and such average factor is consistent with the&lsquo;paid to allowed&rsquo; ratios at the plan level (before leveraging adjustment)&bull;	Companies are allowed to make a Risk Adjustment in developing its incurred claims on the URRT. Risk adjustment calculates a risk score for each plan participant, based upon age, sex and diagnosis. This is used to calculate the company&rsquo;s Plan average risk score. Because HIC anticipates its market level risk scores to be higher than the average risk score for Tennessee, it expects to receive a payment for having a higher risk population. Based on the narrative and spreadsheet provided by the company, INS believes the Risk Adjustment of $58.05 to be actuarially reasonable&bull;	The assumptions and methods used to determine the&lsquo;Projected ACA reinsurance recoveries, net of reinsurance premium, PMPM of $38.07 appear reasonable and consistent with accepted actuarial practice&bull;&lsquo;Administrative Expense Load&rsquo;,&lsquo;Profit&amp; Risk Load&rsquo; and&lsquo;Taxes&amp; Fees&rsquo; appear reasonable for the Individual market&bull;	The&lsquo;Index Rate for Projection Period&rsquo; of $420.40 matches the 2015&lsquo;Projected Allowed Experience Claims PMPM&rsquo;. This is expected for Individual plans that provide only EHBs.Part III Actuarial Memorandum&bull;	The Company&rsquo;s actuarial memorandum satisfies the Part III Actuarial Memorandum and Certification Instructions dated March 20, 2014 and issued by the Department of Health and Human Services&bull;	The company&rsquo;s calculation of the projected medical loss ratio (MLR) of 80.0% is actuarially reasonable&bull;	The company&rsquo;s methodology used to derive the Market Adjusted Index Rate, Plan Adjusted Index Rates, Consumer Adjusted Index Rates and Calibration Factors is consistent with accepted actuarial methods&bull;	The Company&rsquo;s analysis and calculation of Actuarial Values comply with guidance provided in the PPACA, HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2015, Final Rule, 79 FR 13743 (March11, 2014)&bull;	The Company did not have any&ldquo;warning alerts&rdquo; in Worksheet 2 of the URRT&bull;	The actuarial memorandum included the required actuarial certifications.Federal regulations prescribed in 45CFR Part 147 paragraph 147.102&bull;	All premium rates vary only with respect to allowable rating factors: [1] family composition, [2] age, [3] geographic area and [4] tobacco usage&bull;	Relating to the family rating and in accordance with the subject Federal regulation, the premium calculation follows a member-level build up approach which is capped such that no more than the three oldest covered children under the age 21 can be taken into account when determining the total family premium&bull;	Relating to the premium age curve and in accordance with the subject Federal regulation, the premium variation between the youngest and the oldest adult individuals between the ages of 21-64 does not exceed a ratio of 3:1 (and adheres to the Health and Human Services&rsquo; Default Standard Age Curve)&bull;	Relating to tobacco usage, tobacco rates are 10% higher than non-tobacco rates. This is within the 1.5 factor allowed by Federal regulation.Miscellaneous Items&bull;	HIC is offering 46 Individual plans&ndash; 8 Platinum, 8 Gold, 11 Silver, 11 Bronze and 8 Catastrophic&bull;	Pediatric dental benefits are included in some of HIC&rsquo;s Individual plans. Plans with and without pediatric benefits have been priced accordingly. Insureds who purchase plans without pediatric dental benefits can purchase a stand-alone dental policy on the Exchange&bull;	 Regarding the Consumer Adjusted Index Rates, INS confirmed that:1.	The AV Pricing Value was used in developing each plan&rsquo;s proposed premium rates. This was accomplished by multiplying the proposed premiums for plan 82120TN0620002 by the ratio of each plan&rsquo;s AV Pricing Value to the AV Pricing Value of plan 82120TN06200022.	The tobacco rates were 10% higher than the non-tobacco rates for all ages3.	The geographic area factors were applied correctly to all plans4.	The Health and Human Services&rsquo; Default Standard Age Curve was used for all premium ratesBased on INS&rsquo;s review and on the certifying statements of HIC&rsquo;s opining actuary, INS suggests that the subject filing is compliant with Tennessee and PPACA regulations and suggests approval pending the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance review of the filing.",Not Applicable,"Humana Insurance CompanyTennesseeHIOS Identification: 82120The actual rate changes for individual policyholders will vary from the average due to ages of members, the plan andbenefits they select, and the region where they reside.The requested average rate increase for the Humana 2014 PPO products (82120TN062) in this filing, effective January 1,2015, is 11.7 percent when compared to current rates (i.e. rates effective January 1, 2014).Many factors influence this rate calculation.

This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 14.9%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 20,211 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.For Product 61430KS010 the current enrollment is 5,413. These members will have an approximate rate increase of 13.0%.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 7.2%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsWe offer individuals in Kansas a variety of plans to choose from. We are changing some benefits for these plans to comply with state and federal requirements. On average, the benefit and cost sharing changes decreased expected medical costs by an average of 2.1%.Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates. These include:&#61623;&ldquo;Keep What you Have&rdquo; and its impact on the population that will enroll in the plans covered by this filing&#61623; Changes to required taxes and fees&#61623; Phase-out of the Transtional Reinsurance Program which increases rates for plans issued to individualsWill Premiums for All Individuals Increase 13.0%?No, the 13.0% is an average. Some premiums will increase by less or even go down, others will increase by more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the subscriber chooses, the number of members and their ages, where in Kansas the subscriber is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Individual business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Coventry's secure member portal, My Online Services, which was designed to empower our members to become more involved in their health care by allowing them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services. Additionally, Aetna&rsquo;s Plan for Your Health website aims to educate all consumers, not just Aetna and Coventry members, on how to take advantage of their health care benefits.",Review Complete,13.00,61430KS010,KS PPO Individual Exchange,Coventry Health and Life,KANSAS,KS,Annual,13.66,13.66,RC

Medical Loss Ratio (MLR)	83.86%	84.64%",Not Applicable,"Excellus Health Plan, Inc. (NAIC code number 55107) has applied to the Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services to adjust premium rates for its community-rated small group and individual qualified health plans.I. OVERVIEWThe rates being sought contain a zero percent operating margin for the health plan despite the health plan reporting operating losses in 2013 and a forecasted significant operating loss in 2014. The proposed rate adjustment is based on the need to adjust prospectively from the state&rsquo;s reduction of rates by 6.3% on small group qualified health plans and by 4.0% on individual qualified health plans for 2014, an increasing medical cost trend, and changes in the health insurance market driven by federal and state actions. Other contributing factors for the proposed 2015 rate adjustment include increases in fees, taxes and added coverage for new mandated benefits.Excellus Health Plan and related companies (EHP) provide health insurance and administrative services for about 1.8 million upstate New Yorkers in 39 counties. The proposed premium rates affect about 182,000 members or 10% of the health plan&rsquo;s total membership. Its proposed rates are subject to review by the New York Department of Financial Services pursuant to section 4308c of the New York Insurance Law. The Department may approve the proposed rate increase as requested, modify the proposed rate increase, or disapprove the proposed rate increase in its entirety. The determination by the Department shall be supported by sound actuarial assumptions and methods.The rate application will be filed with the Department on or about June 13, 2014. The actual rate increases approved by the Department will be communicated to the impacted parties at least 60 days prior to the date the new rate is implemented for the subscriber. EHP policyholders with renewal dates during 2015 would, if approved, receive the indicated rate adjustments on their next anniversary date on or after January 1, 2015.Excellus Health Plan is required by New York State law to develop rates that assume that at least 82% of premium revenue will be spent on health care costs in the direct pay market along with small groups, be actuarially sound, cover all claim costs, and provide a contribution to ensure adequate reserves. The percent of premium attributable to claims is referred to as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).Excellus Health Plan's MLR has been and continues to exceed the statutory minimums. In 2013, the MLR for Excellus Health Plan was 94.2% for individual direct pay and 91.0% for small groups. Under new reporting requirements for 2014, the three-year cumulative MLR is 94.4% for individual direct pay and 91.5% for small group qualified health plans. With the proposed rate adjustments, Excellus Health Plan's MLRs would remain well above the minimum levels. In the event the MLR falls below the required minimum, the health plan refunds any difference to policyholders.Periodic rate adjustments are necessary to secure the ability of Excellus Health Plan, or any insurer, to produce sufficient revenue and surplus for reserves to assure continued coverage and claim payments both for current health care needs, and potential catastrophic cost situations. Excellus Health Plan's reserves vary from year to year based on actual health care costs incurred. As of Dec. 31, 2013, the health plan had reserves equivalent to 2.5 months of claims and operating expense, and more than the minimum required by New York State law. These reserves are the insurance that assures payment even when costs run higher than anticipated, or emergencies or disasters occur, and should not be used as an alternative fund to temporarily reduce rate adjustments.In filing its rate application, Excellus Health Plan is sensitive to the fact that individuals and small businesses struggle to afford higher premiums. However, it is clear that an increase in premiums is necessary to assure the continued operations of the Plan and the viability of its product offerings. Because EHP already has a high MLR, failure to approve these rates would only lead to the need for even greater rate increases in the future as claim costs would eventually exceed premiums collected.II. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASEEscalating health care costsThe cost of health care services, equipment and products continues to be the primary reason for rate increases.Trend is a very important consideration in determining the need for a premium rate adjustment. Upstate New York is not immune to national trends in health care costs given our state&rsquo;s population and demographics. Industry experts such as Segal Consulting and Buck Consultants are forecasting a 7.2-10.4% medical benefit trend nationwide for 2014. EHP is forecasting an overall medical benefit trend factor for its commercial fully insured business of 6.8% for 2014-2015. The trend forecast takes into account projected increases in costs attributed to what Excellus Health Plan pays out in claims expenses for hospital inpatient and outpatient care, professional services, pharmacy benefits and other goods and services. The health plan&rsquo;s anticipated changes in medical benefit spending are summarized as follows:Hospital inpatient, 6.9%Hospital outpatient, 6.4%Professional services, 4.5%Pharmacy, 10.6%Other medical goods and services, 7.5%These trends do not include adjustments to base rates for previous rate increases that were insufficient to cover claims and operating expenses for some plan options.Health care costs for each of those benefit components take into account the compounding effects of both the price of the goods or services provided as well as the quantity of the goods and services consumed.The impact that each trend has to the overall cost of coverage is related to proportionate size of the benefit component. For example, overall spending would rise faster as a result of a 5% increase in professional services versus a 5% increase in drug costs because professional services represents a larger share of medical benefit spending.III. NEW YORK TAXES AND ASSESSMENTSInsurance taxes are built into the costs of health coverage. New Yorkers who voluntarily purchase private health insurance coverage paid more than $4 billion in state health taxes in 2011, according to an analysis by the New York State Conference of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans.New York&rsquo;s Health Care Reform Act of 1996 (HCRA) created two surcharges on health insurance and an additional tax is imposed under Section 206 (formerly Section 332) of the state Insurance Law.The covered lives assessment is an annual flat surcharge or tax on every person who has insurance coverage in the state. Health plans are assessed on the basis of the number of people they cover with individual and family rates that vary depending on the residence of the insured. Among upstate regions defined by the state, the annual covered lives assessment rates in 2014 that impact Excellus Health Plan members are as follows:Per Certificate Per Year by region (Individual : Family)Western: $39.40: $130.03Rochester: $105.72: $348.87Central: $55.59: $183.46Utica-Watertown: $8.54: $28.17Northeastern: $39.94: $131.79The second surcharge created by the 1996 Health Care Reform Act is collected from health plans in the form of a sales tax on many hospital-related services. The surcharge is applied to both self-insured and fully insured plans. Beginning at 8.18% in 1997, the surcharge is now at 9.63%.The third levy, the Section 206 assessment, was originally established to finance New York State Department of Insurance operations but its funding purposes have expanded beyond that purpose. The assessments apply to all licensed insurers in the state (e.g. life, property and casualty, and health), and are based on New York premiums.In total, the above New York taxes and assessments including Section 206 aggregated to nearly 6% of the 2015 small group and individual qualified health plans&rsquo; premium.IV. FEDERAL TAXES, MANDATES AND ADJUSTMENTSAnnual fee on health insurance providers:Beginning in 2014, this fee is based on each health insurance company&rsquo;s market share of net premiums written, adjusted for size and corporate structure.The federal law requires the total fee on nationwide health insurance providers to be collected is:$8 billion in 2014,$11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016,$13.9 billion in 2017, and$14.3 billion in 2018.After 2018, the fee is expected to collect $14.3 billion, indexed to the rate of growth in premiums.Each year, the calculation will be based on the market share of each assessed plan and will change based on the number of companies in the insured market. Under this fee provision, a health plan could incur financial losses but would still be subject to the market share fee.For EHP, this fee increase represents a 1.2% increase to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans for 2015.Risk Adjustment Program:The risk adjustment program is a permanent provision that applies to both the individual and small group insurance market. This federal program assesses a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and uses the revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members.A fee of $0.96 per member per year is collected to fund the risk adjustment program. For EHP, this program reduces small group qualified health plans&rsquo; premiums by about 1.5%. For 2015, this program has no impact on the premium of individual direct pay qualified health plans.Transitional reinsurance program for the individual market:The federal law created a temporary reinsurance program that is to collect nationwide:$10 billion in 2014,$6 billion in 2015, and$4 billion in 2016.Additionally, a separate contribution is to be deposited into the U.S. Treasury that will total $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016.The contribution rate is to be based on a $44 national per capita yearly amount in 2015. All insurers and self- insured group health plans are required to contribute on behalf of all group health plans and health insurance coverage they provide. For EHP, this fee represents about 1% of premium but it is about 40% less than last year resulting in a 0.5% decrease to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans in 2015.For the individual qualified health plans, the federal government established reinsurance for excessive claims. The amount of money being distributed in 2014 is being reduced in 2015. At the same time, this reduction will require a 3.8% premium increase for individual qualified health plans.Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) fee:The federal law created the PCORI to help stakeholders make informed health decisions by advancing the quality and relevance of evidence-based medicine through the use of comparative clinical effectiveness research findings. The fee is set at $2 per year multiplied by the average number of lives covered under the plan for plan years ending before October 1, 2014. And, for plan years ending on or after October 1, 2014, the fee increases based on the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures.Federal mental health mandateThe federal requirements for coverage of mental health parity require a 0.2% increase to current premium to pay for required benefits in 2015.V. OPERATING EXPENSE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTSA portion of what is reported to the state as administrative expenses is attributed to what Federal Health Reform considers quality improvement expenses, meaning the federal government recognizes that these represent costs that lead to overall improvements in health care versus simply a routine business expense, and as a result will be considered a medical benefit expense for purposes of federal MLR calculations.Those quality improvement expenses include such items as:-Improvements in health outcomes brought about by case management and disease management programs,-Actions taken to help prevent hospital readmissions through such things as discharge planning and counseling,-Wellness and community health promotional activities, and-Health information technology that is used to help measure clinical effectiveness and predictive modeling.The proposed rates will more accurately reflect the true operating expense of administering the federal Health Care Reform legislation through the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange. The changes in the health insurance market required building and implementing an entirely new sales channel from what had primarily been a business-to-business marketplace.This required:-The implementation of a new sales call center that saw extended open enrollment deadlines in 2014,-The hiring of additional staff,-Increased direct-to-consumer communication costs to educate consumers about new products and how to access those products, and-The building and implementation of new products, new infrastructure for the continued improvements and changes to the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange and for the implementation of additional mandates for the federal Health Care Reform.Operating expenses - including quality improvement initiatives but excluding federal and state taxes, fees and assessments, and broker commissions - represent 8.7% of premium in small group qualified health plans and 8.4% in individual qualified health plans.VI. REGULATION 146Regulation 146 was a market stabilization mechanism for the individual and small group pools that was in effect prior to the adoption of the ACA. Similar to the ACA Risk Adjustment program, Reg. 146 attempted to equalize the risk within the small group and individual markets by assessing a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and used this revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members. Because of the redundancy with the new risk adjustment program, Reg. 146 is being phased out. The Department of Financial Services is requiring plans to distribute all outstanding compensations through premium adjustments in 2015 and 2016. This distribution plan results in a reduction in the small group qualified health plan premium of 0.3% and in individual premium of about 1%.",Review Complete,9.23,78124NY089,ExcellusBCBS EPO Hybrid,"Excellus Health Plan, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Annual,19.79,19.79,RC

The percent of premium attributable to claims is referred to as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).Excellus Health Plan's MLR has been and continues to exceed the statutory minimums. In 2013, the MLR for Excellus Health Plan was 94.2% for individual direct pay and 91.0% for small groups. Under new reporting requirements for 2014, the three-year cumulative MLR is 94.4% for individual direct pay and 91.5% for small group qualified health plans. With the proposed rate adjustments, Excellus Health Plan's MLRs would remain well above the minimum levels. In the event the MLR falls below the required minimum, the health plan refunds any difference to policyholders.Periodic rate adjustments are necessary to secure the ability of Excellus Health Plan, or any insurer, to produce sufficient revenue and surplus for reserves to assure continued coverage and claim payments both for current health care needs, and potential catastrophic cost situations. Excellus Health Plan's reserves vary from year to year based on actual health care costs incurred. As of Dec. 31, 2013, the health plan had reserves equivalent to 2.5 months of claims and operating expense, and more than the minimum required by New York State law. These reserves are the insurance that assures payment even when costs run higher than anticipated, or emergencies or disasters occur, and should not be used as an alternative fund to temporarily reduce rate adjustments.In filing its rate application, Excellus Health Plan is sensitive to the fact that individuals and small businesses struggle to afford higher premiums. However, it is clear that an increase in premiums is necessary to assure the continued operations of the Plan and the viability of its product offerings. Because EHP already has a high MLR, failure to approve these rates would only lead to the need for even greater rate increases in the future as claim costs would eventually exceed premiums collected.II. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASEEscalating health care costsThe cost of health care services, equipment and products continues to be the primary reason for rate increases.Trend is a very important consideration in determining the need for a premium rate adjustment. Upstate New York is not immune to national trends in health care costs given our state&rsquo;s population and demographics. Industry experts such as Segal Consulting and Buck Consultants are forecasting a 7.2-10.4% medical benefit trend nationwide for 2014. EHP is forecasting an overall medical benefit trend factor for its commercial fully insured business of 6.8% for 2014-2015. The trend forecast takes into account projected increases in costs attributed to what Excellus Health Plan pays out in claims expenses for hospital inpatient and outpatient care, professional services, pharmacy benefits and other goods and services. The health plan&rsquo;s anticipated changes in medical benefit spending are summarized as follows:Hospital inpatient, 6.9%Hospital outpatient, 6.4%Professional services, 4.5%Pharmacy, 10.6%Other medical goods and services, 7.5%These trends do not include adjustments to base rates for previous rate increases that were insufficient to cover claims and operating expenses for some plan options.Health care costs for each of those benefit components take into account the compounding effects of both the price of the goods or services provided as well as the quantity of the goods and services consumed.The impact that each trend has to the overall cost of coverage is related to proportionate size of the benefit component. For example, overall spending would rise faster as a result of a 5% increase in professional services versus a 5% increase in drug costs because professional services represents a larger share of medical benefit spending.III. NEW YORK TAXES AND ASSESSMENTSInsurance taxes are built into the costs of health coverage. New Yorkers who voluntarily purchase private health insurance coverage paid more than $4 billion in state health taxes in 2011, according to an analysis by the New York State Conference of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans.New York&rsquo;s Health Care Reform Act of 1996 (HCRA) created two surcharges on health insurance and an additional tax is imposed under Section 206 (formerly Section 332) of the state Insurance Law.The covered lives assessment is an annual flat surcharge or tax on every person who has insurance coverage in the state. Health plans are assessed on the basis of the number of people they cover with individual and family rates that vary depending on the residence of the insured. Among upstate regions defined by the state, the annual covered lives assessment rates in 2014 that impact Excellus Health Plan members are as follows:Per Certificate Per Year by region (Individual : Family)Western: $39.40: $130.03Rochester: $105.72: $348.87Central: $55.59: $183.46Utica-Watertown: $8.54: $28.17Northeastern: $39.94: $131.79The second surcharge created by the 1996 Health Care Reform Act is collected from health plans in the form of a sales tax on many hospital-related services. The surcharge is applied to both self-insured and fully insured plans. Beginning at 8.18% in 1997, the surcharge is now at 9.63%.The third levy, the Section 206 assessment, was originally established to finance New York State Department of Insurance operations but its funding purposes have expanded beyond that purpose. The assessments apply to all licensed insurers in the state (e.g. life, property and casualty, and health), and are based on New York premiums.In total, the above New York taxes and assessments including Section 206 aggregated to nearly 6% of the 2015 small group and individual qualified health plans&rsquo; premium.IV. FEDERAL TAXES, MANDATES AND ADJUSTMENTSAnnual fee on health insurance providers:Beginning in 2014, this fee is based on each health insurance company&rsquo;s market share of net premiums written, adjusted for size and corporate structure.The federal law requires the total fee on nationwide health insurance providers to be collected is:$8 billion in 2014,$11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016,$13.9 billion in 2017, and$14.3 billion in 2018.After 2018, the fee is expected to collect $14.3 billion, indexed to the rate of growth in premiums.Each year, the calculation will be based on the market share of each assessed plan and will change based on the number of companies in the insured market. Under this fee provision, a health plan could incur financial losses but would still be subject to the market share fee.For EHP, this fee increase represents a 1.2% increase to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans for 2015.Risk Adjustment Program:The risk adjustment program is a permanent provision that applies to both the individual and small group insurance market. This federal program assesses a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and uses the revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members.A fee of $0.96 per member per year is collected to fund the risk adjustment program. For EHP, this program reduces small group qualified health plans&rsquo; premiums by about 1.5%. For 2015, this program has no impact on the premium of individual direct pay qualified health plans.Transitional reinsurance program for the individual market:The federal law created a temporary reinsurance program that is to collect nationwide:$10 billion in 2014,$6 billion in 2015, and$4 billion in 2016.Additionally, a separate contribution is to be deposited into the U.S. Treasury that will total $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016.The contribution rate is to be based on a $44 national per capita yearly amount in 2015. All insurers and self- insured group health plans are required to contribute on behalf of all group health plans and health insurance coverage they provide. For EHP, this fee represents about 1% of premium but it is about 40% less than last year resulting in a 0.5% decrease to current premium for small group and individual qualified health plans in 2015.For the individual qualified health plans, the federal government established reinsurance for excessive claims. The amount of money being distributed in 2014 is being reduced in 2015. At the same time, this reduction will require a 3.8% premium increase for individual qualified health plans.Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) fee:The federal law created the PCORI to help stakeholders make informed health decisions by advancing the quality and relevance of evidence-based medicine through the use of comparative clinical effectiveness research findings. The fee is set at $2 per year multiplied by the average number of lives covered under the plan for plan years ending before October 1, 2014. And, for plan years ending on or after October 1, 2014, the fee increases based on the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures.Federal mental health mandateThe federal requirements for coverage of mental health parity require a 0.2% increase to current premium to pay for required benefits in 2015.V. OPERATING EXPENSE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTSA portion of what is reported to the state as administrative expenses is attributed to what Federal Health Reform considers quality improvement expenses, meaning the federal government recognizes that these represent costs that lead to overall improvements in health care versus simply a routine business expense, and as a result will be considered a medical benefit expense for purposes of federal MLR calculations.Those quality improvement expenses include such items as:-Improvements in health outcomes brought about by case management and disease management programs,-Actions taken to help prevent hospital readmissions through such things as discharge planning and counseling,-Wellness and community health promotional activities, and-Health information technology that is used to help measure clinical effectiveness and predictive modeling.The proposed rates will more accurately reflect the true operating expense of administering the federal Health Care Reform legislation through the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange. The changes in the health insurance market required building and implementing an entirely new sales channel from what had primarily been a business-to-business marketplace.This required:-The implementation of a new sales call center that saw extended open enrollment deadlines in 2014,-The hiring of additional staff,-Increased direct-to-consumer communication costs to educate consumers about new products and how to access those products, and-The building and implementation of new products, new infrastructure for the continued improvements and changes to the state&rsquo;s on-line exchange and for the implementation of additional mandates for the federal Health Care Reform.Operating expenses - including quality improvement initiatives but excluding federal and state taxes, fees and assessments, and broker commissions - represent 8.7% of premium in small group qualified health plans and 8.4% in individual qualified health plans.VI. REGULATION 146Regulation 146 was a market stabilization mechanism for the individual and small group pools that was in effect prior to the adoption of the ACA. Similar to the ACA Risk Adjustment program, Reg. 146 attempted to equalize the risk within the small group and individual markets by assessing a charge on health plans that have low-risk members and used this revenue to compensate plans with higher risk members. Because of the redundancy with the new risk adjustment program, Reg. 146 is being phased out. The Department of Financial Services is requiring plans to distribute all outstanding compensations through premium adjustments in 2015 and 2016. This distribution plan results in a reduction in the small group qualified health plan premium of 0.3% and in individual premium of about 1%.",Review Complete,9.23,78124NY094,Univera EPO Hybrid,"Excellus Health Plan, Inc.",NEW YORK,NY,Annual,20.27,20.27,RC

Some premiums will increase by less or more than the average. The exact rate change will depend on the age and family size for enrolling members, where in Missouri the subscriber is located, and which members use tobacco.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Individual business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Coventry makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Coventry doing to keep premiums affordable?Coventry is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&#61623; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&#61623; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Coventry is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have.

The Department concluded that these standards were met and consequently the rates were not disapproved.",Not Applicable,"SummaryAetna is filing rates for Small Group plans in New Jersey. This filing proposes to reduce premium rates from our prior filing. The resulting annual increase is 12.9%.Who is affected?The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from April 2015 through December 2015. As of September 2014, approximately 6,000 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply. Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal. Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.Why We Need to Increase PremiumsMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase. We expect medical costs to go up 11.2%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below. Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.For Small Employers in New Jersey, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:&bull; Expenses for emergency treatment have increased 10%.&bull; Primary care physician office visits have increased 10%.&bull; Costs for pharmacy prescriptions have gone up 11%.What Else Affects Our Request to Increase PremiumsThe rates in this filing reflect the impacts of a number of ACA-related requirements, including changes to taxes and fees and changes to benefit requirements.Will Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 12.9%?No, the 12.9% is an average. Rate changes differ by product due to the impact of benefit changes. These average increases are:&bull; 15.6% for EPO plans&bull; 10.0% for POS plans&bull; 11.9% for Indemnity plansThe exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, and the age and family size for enrolling employees.Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014.How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?Aetna is taking a number of actions to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care. These actions include:&bull; Developing new agreements, arrangements, and partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.&bull; Creating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Aetna Navigator, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services. Additionally, Aetna&rsquo;s Plan for Your Health website aims to educate all consumers, not just Aetna members, on how to take advantage of their health care benefits.",Review Complete,10.45,89217NJ008,Aetna Managed Choice,Aetna Life Insurance Company,NEW JERSEY,NJ,Quarterly,10.45,10.45,RC
