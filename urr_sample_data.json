This filing proposes to raise average premium rates by 25.3%.<br/><br/>Who is affected?<br/>The rates will apply to policies that start or renew from January 2015 through December 2015. Approximately 27,700 members are enrolled in plans to which the new rates will apply.  Some plans in this market may not be available for renewal.  Members in those plans will be able to enroll in the new plans included in this filing.<br/><br/>Why We Need to Increase Premiums<br/>Medical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase.  We expect medical costs to go up 11.9%, excluding the effect of benefit changes described below.  Medical costs go up mainly for two reasons&nbsp&ndash; providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.<br/><br/>For Small Employers in New York, some examples of increasing medical costs we have experienced in the last 12 months include:<br/>&bull;&nbspThe cost for an inpatient hospital admission has increased 7.3%.<br/>&bull;&nbspExpenses for emergency treatment have increased 14.8%.<br/>&bull;&nbspExpenses related to Physician services have gone up 7.4%.<br/>&bull;&nbspOutpatient mental health costs have gone up 7.9%.<br/><br/>What Else Affects Our Request to Increase Premiums<br/>We offer New York small businesses a variety of plans to choose from.  We are changing some benefits for these plans in 2015, and on average, the benefit and cost sharing will change medical costs by an average of 2%.<br/><br/>Several requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates.  These include:<br/>&bull;&nbspEnhanced network access standards&nbsp&ndash; which limit our ability to control the cost and quality of medical care<br/>&bull;&nbspChanges to required taxes and fees<br/><br/>Will Premiums for All Small Groups Increase 25.3%?<br/>No, the 25.3% is an average.  Rate changes differ by product due to the impact of benefit changes.  These average increase are:<br/>&bull;&nbsp26.1% for Product 17210NY008<br/>&bull;&nbsp25.3% for Product 17210NY009<br/><br/>In addition, some premiums will increase by less or more than the average.  The exact rate change will depend on what benefit plan the group chooses, when the group&rsquo;s contract renews, the family size for enrolling employees, and where in New York the group is located.<br/><br/>Changes in the premium that members pay will also depend on whether the current policy complies with ACA requirements that took effect on January 1, 2014, and the impact of changes in government tax subsidies.<br/><br/>How does this request align to Minimum Loss Ratio Requirements (MLR)?<br/>These rates are expected to produce an MLR equal to or above the 80% requirement for Small Group business. Under the ACA, at least 80% of the premiums collected by health plans are expected to pay for medical care and activities that improve health care quality for members. If the actual MLR turns out to be less than 80%, rebates will be issued to members in accordance with the law.<br/><br/>Aetna makes significant investments that benefit our members that the government does not allow us to use in this calculation. These investments include customer service, and health quality activities like disease management programs, as well as the development of new information technologies.<br/><br/>What is Aetna doing to keep premiums affordable?<br/>Aetna is taking a number of steps to keep our products as affordable as possible and to address the underlying cost of health care.  These actions include:<br/>&bull;&nbspDeveloping new agreements, arrangements, and  partnerships with health care providers that base provider compensation on the quality of care and not the quantity of services.<br/>&bull;&nbspCreating medical management programs that address potential health issues for members earlier, improving health outcomes and reducing the need for high-cost health care services.<br/><br/>Aetna is also dedicated to increasing transparency within the health care system and helping members best utilize the plans that they have. Members can access Aetna Navigator, a secure member website, which allows them to research their specific plan benefits, health care providers in a given area, and in some locations, the cost of certain health care services. Additionally, Aetna&rsquo;s Plan for Your Health website aims to educate all consumers, not just Aetna members, on how to take advantage of their health care benefits.<br/>","reviewStatus":"Review Complete","modifiedRate":"28","productID":"27210NY008","productName":"Aetna Fee for Health Rewards","issuerName":"Aetna Life Insurance Company","stateName":"NEW YORK","stateCode":"NY","reviewPeriod":"Annual","thresholdRateIncrease":"48","reviewStatusCode":"FJCS"},{"submissionIdentifier":"1077914","issuerCode":"27210","market":"Individual","primCode":"ST","effectiveDate":"1/2/2015","ffmPlans":"FALSE","submissionDate":"6/2014/2014","currentStatusDate":"6/27/2014","finalDetermination":"Not Unreasonable (Modified)","reviewerComments":"Not Applicable","issuerResponseComments":"Not Applicable","narrativeComments":"Summary<br/>Aetna is filing rates for Small Group plans in New York.
